The Michigan index is almost identical to the Conference Board Consumer Confidence index, though there are two monthly releases, a preliminary and final reading. Like the Conference Board index, it has two subindexes - expectations and current conditions. The expectations index is a component of the Conference Board's Leading Indicators index. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy, so the markets follow any indicator relating to consumer behavior and attitudes. The more confident consumers are about the economy and their own personal finances, the more likely they are to spend.

It meets eight times per year to determine the near-term direction of monetary policy, such as setting guidelines for the purchase and sale of government securities and setting policy relating to System operations in the foreign exchange markets. These changes in monetary policy are now announced immediately after FOMC meetings. Most importantly, the Fed determines interest rate policy at FOMC meetings. Market participants speculate about the possibility of an interest rate change at these meetings, and if the outcome is different from expectations, the impact on the markets can be dramatic and far-reaching. The interest rate set by the Fed the federal funds rate serves as a benchmark for all other rates. A change in the fed funds rate, the lending rate banks charge each other for the use of overnight funds, translates directly through to all other interest rates from Treasury bonds to mortgage loans. It also changes the dynamics of competition for investor dollars: when bonds yield 10 percent, they will attract more money away from stocks then when they only yield 5 percent.

The focus on money supply has long since been abandoned, however. To the extent that money supply is still monitored by the market, M2 is the favored monetary aggregate. The Fed still targets both M2 and M3 in a rhetorical sense, but these targets mean little when it comes to policy decisions. If the Fed misses its target, it is more likely to change the target than it is to change policy. In 2000, the Fed finally abandoned the targets altogether, thereby removing any remaining emphasis on this one-time star release.<br><br><b>In Depth</b>Though money supply measures were long ago relegated to the bottom of the Fed's list of policy tools, they are still useful in providing clues regarding the strength of the economy. This article offers a refresher on just what the monetary aggregates are - how they are constructed, why they matter, and how much the Fed cares about each. Let's start with the strict definitions.<br><br>M1, the narrowest of the monetary aggregates, contains the following:<br>1. Currency, except that held by the Fed, Treasury, or banks/thrifts 2. Travelers checks 3. Demand deposits (non-interest bearing checking accounts), except those due to banks, the government, or foreign institutions 4. Other checkable deposits - most notably NOW (negotiable order of withdrawal) accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>M2, the aggregate which the Fed watches most closely, contains the following:<br>1. M1<br>2. Savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts- MMDAs) \\r\\n<br>3. Time deposits (known commonly as CDs or certificates of deposit) in denominations of less than $100,000 \\r\\n<br>4. Balances in retail money market funds (retail funds have minimum initial investments of less than $50,000) <br><br>Finally, M3 - the broadest aggregate - contains:<br>\\r\\n1. M2 \\r\\n<br>2. Time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more \\r\\n<br>3. Balances in institutional money market funds (minimum investments of more than $50,000) \\r\\n<br>4. Overnight and term repurchase agreements \\r\\n<br>5. Overnight and term eurodollars held by U.S. residents\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<u>The Decline of M1</u><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, M1 was directly targetted by the Federal Reserve, and its weekly release was of critical importance to the financial markets. Today, M1 is barely noticed, and its stock continues to decline. The reason for M1's demise as a useful indicator is financial deregulation, which enabled individuals to hold transaction balances in accounts such as MMDAs which were not included in M1. More recently, M1 has lost what little usefulness it had left as sweep accounts have undermined the narrow aggregate. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><u>Sweeps-stakes</u>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>Sweep accounts are a hybrid checking account/savings account. In a typical sweep account, banks will sweep part of a NOW account's balance into an MMDA. As funds are needed to cover checks written against the NOW account, the bank will periodically shift funds from the MMDA back into the NOW account. Since the legal maximum number of withdrawals from an MMDA is six per month, all funds will be shifted back to the NOW account on the sixth transaction of the month. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br>Sweep accounts benefit both banks and depositors. Banks benefit because MMDAs do not require any reserves to be held with the Fed, while NOW accounts are reservable. As these required reserves are non-interest bearing, banks benefit by reducing their level of required reserves. Depositors benefit because MMDAs carry higher interest rates, and thus earnings on checking balances are increased. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br>As NOW accounts are in M1 and MMDAs are in M2, M1 has been dramatically weakened by sweeps, while M2 has not been affected (since M2 already includes M1, a shift from a NOW account to an MMDA has no impact on M2). \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<u>The Rise and Fall and Rise of M2</u>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>M2 is the most closely watched monetary aggregate - both by economists and the Federal Reserve. The 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act mandated that the Fed set annual targets for money supply and that the Fed Chairman report to Congress twice each year regarding these targets. The Fed used to take that responsibility quite seriously - setting point targets for M1 growth, and later setting target ranges for M2 and M3. Finally, in 2000, the Fed abandoned these money targetting altogether. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>he reduced emphasis on M2 first became evident in the late 1980s but was sealed in the early 1990s. M2 is a useful indicator only so long as its velocity (the rate of turnover of a dollar of M2, or mathematically, nominal GDP divided by M2) is stable over the long term. Unfortunately, the long term stability of M2 velocity, which was at the core of monetarism, disappeared beginning in the late 1980s. Banks and thrifts, devastated by nonperforming assets, pulled back from their traditional lending business, with market financing sources picking up the slack. The result was a break from the long term trend in M2 velocity. Suddenly, one dollar of M2 could fund far more nominal GDP growth, as market financing increased the efficiency of the financial system. Regardless of the hows and whys - which are still debated by economists - the bottom line was that M2 was no longer a reliable indicator. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br>It will take many years of predictable velocity before the Fed once again places much emphasis on M2 in its policy deliberations. And it is safe to say that neither M2 nor any other monetary aggregate will occupy the top spot in policy making as M1 did in the early 1980s. The record of interest rate targetting has simply been much better than that of money targetting. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<u>M3: Still Bringing Up the Rear</u>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>M3 attracts more attention than it did previously, due largely to the demise of M1, but its inclusion of institutional accounts makes it less attractive than M2, which focusses on individual deposit accounts. The bottom line in determining which aggregate receives the most attention is the relative stability of its velocity. Even though M2 velocity went off course in the early 1990s, it has still been the most predictable of the three during the postwar period. \\r\\n\",\"eclong121\":\"Wholsale Inventories\",\"eclong123\":\"<br><br>The Producer Price Index measures prices of goods at the wholesale level.

An early or flash estimate, based on incomplete data is released about two weeks before the detailed release.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The measure of choice in the European Monetary Union (EMU) is the harmonized index of consumer prices which has been constructed to allow cross member state comparisons. An investor who understands how inflation influences the markets will benefit over those investors that do not understand the impact. In the European Monetary Union, where monetary policy decisions rest on the ECB's inflation target, the rate of inflation directly affects all interest rates charged to business and the consumer. <br/><br/>Inflation is an increase in the overall prices of goods and services. The relationship between inflation and interest rates is the key to understanding how indicators such as the CPI influence the markets - and your investments.<br/><br/>Inflation (along with various risks) basically explains how interest rates are set on everything from your mortgage and auto loans to Treasury bills, notes and bonds. As the rate of inflation changes and as expectations on inflation change, the markets adjust interest rates. The effect ripples across stocks, bonds, commodities, and your portfolio, often in a dramatic fashion.<br/><br/>By tracking inflation, whether high or low, rising or falling, investors can anticipate how different types of investments will perform. Over the long run, the bond market will rally (fall) when increases in the HICP are small (large). The equity market rallies with the bond market because low inflation promises low interest rates and is good for profits.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly\",\"eclong13\":\"<br><br>Personal income measures income from all sources.

Beyond that, there are many other categories of income, including rental income, government subsidy payments, interest income, and dividend income. Personal income is a decent indicator of future consumer demand, but it is not perfect. Recessions usually occur when consumers stop spending, which then drives down income growth. Looking solely at income growth, one may therefore miss the turning point when consumers stop spending.<br><br>The income report also includes a section covering personal consumption expenditures, also known as PCE. PCE is comprised of three categories: durables, nondurables, and services.

To address this problem, a harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) have been developed within EU, based on coordinated methodology.

The GDP report contains a treasure-trove of information which not only paints an image of the overall economy, but tells investors about important trends within the big picture. These data, which follow the international classification system (SNA93), are readily comparable to other industrialized countries. GDP components such as consumer spending, business and residential investment, and price (inflation) indexes illuminate the economy's undercurrents, which can translate to investment opportunities and guidance in managing a portfolio.<br/><br/>Each financial market reacts differently to GDP data because of their focus. For example, equity market participants cheer healthy economic growth because it improves the corporate profit outlook while weak growth generally means anemic earnings. Equities generally drop on disappointing growth and climb on good growth prospects. <br/><br/>Bond or fixed income markets are contrarians. They prefer weak growth so that there is less of a chance of higher central bank interest rates and inflation. When GDP growth is poor or negative it indicates anemic or negative economic activity. Bond prices will rise and interest rates will fall. When growth is positive and good, interest rates will be higher and bond prices lower.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Quarterly\",\"eclong142\":\"<br><br>Personal income measures income from all sources.

Goods prices at the crude and intermediate stages of production often provide an indication of coming (dis)inflationary pressures, but the closer you get to crude goods, the more that these prices track commodity prices which are already available in traded indexes such as the CRB (Commodity Research Bureau). \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAt all stages of production, the market places more emphasis on the index excluding food and energy, referred to as the core rate. Food and energy prices tend to be quite volatile and obscure trends in the underlying inflation rate. Though the market reaction is determined by the month/month changes, year/year changes are also noted by analysts. The index is not revised on a monthly basis, but annual revisions to seasonal adjustment factors can produce small adjustments to past releases.\\r\\n\",\"eclong1551127\":\" -  Retail Sales<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>Retail sales measure the total receipts at stores that sell durable and nondurable goods.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>With consumer spending a large part of the economy, market players continually monitor spending patterns.

The Philadelphia Fed's survey is first each month, actually coming out during the third week of the month for which it is reporting. Several smaller surveys are then released before the Chicago purchasing managers' report on the last day of each month. A few, such as the Atlanta and Richmond Fed surveys, are released after the NAPM and are of little value. The purchasing managers' reports are measured like the national NAPM - 50% marks the breakeven line between an expanding and contracting manufacturing sector. For the Philadelphia and Atlanta Fed indexes, 0 is the breakeven mark. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese surveys can be of some help in forecasting the national NAPM - particularly the Philadelphia and Chicago surveys which are more closely watched due to their timeliness and the fact that these regions represent a reasonable cross section of national manufacturing activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>In Depth</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe market has been bombarded with a bevy of surveys purporting to measure manufacturing activity in every nook and cranny of the country. First it was Philadelphia, then Chicago, and Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Cincinnati, Richmond, Atlanta, Boston, and there might as well have been a Nome survey. This hodge-podge of releases is begging for someone - namely us - to come along and cut this group down to a more manageable size. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Nuts and Bolts</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nLet's start with the issue of what these manufacturing surveys are trying to measure and how they go about doing it. The leader of this pack of regional surveys is the ISM index which comes from the Institute for Supply Management (formerly the National Association of Purchasing Managers). It has been around since 1931 (1948 on an uninterrupted basis), it is national, and it is one of the most timely measures of manufacturing activity available. In other words, it sets the standards by which its progeny are measured. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ISM index is actually a composite of five sub-indexes - new orders, production, supplier deliveries, inventories, and employment. In surveying over 300 companies each month, the ISM asks for positive, negative, or unchanged readings on each of these indicators. The positive responses are added to one half of the unchanged responses to produce the diffusion index. For example, if 50% of respondents reported stronger orders, 40% reported weaker, and 10% unchanged, the diffusion index for orders would be 55%, the 50% positive plus half of the 10% unchanged. To calculate the total index, the ISM uses weights for the five indicators, which are as follows: 30% new orders, 25% production, 20% employment, 15% supplier deliveries, and 10% inventories. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>The Selection Criteria</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nSince this methodology has made the ISM index one of the better leading indicators of economic activity over the years, we will measure the usefulness of the regional indexes based on their ability to help in forecasting the national index. In our effort to arrive at the most important regional indices, these criteria make eliminating most of the candidates easy for one simple reason - they are released after the national index. While regional economic developments are of interest to those who live in the region, they are not particularly important to the markets. If a region cannot help in forecasting national trends, then its data are not particularly useful. So say adios to Atlanta, Richmond, Kansas City, and who knows how many others which have cropped up in recent years. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>And the Winner Is...</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nLet's focus on the regional surveys which precede the release of the national index on the first business day of each month (with data for the prior month). The contestants are Philadelphia, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, New York, and the most recent addition to the bunch - the APICS survey. We looked at the correlation of all of these indexes to the national NAPM and found substantial differences in their forecasting ability. The winners are...drum roll please...Chicago and Philadelphia, in that order. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chicago PMI (officially known as the Business Barometer) is a monthly composite index based on opinion surveys of more than 200 Chicago purchasing managers regarding the manufacturing industry. The survey responses are limited to three options: slower, faster and same. As such, the index will not capture if a component is growing but at a much slower rate or vice versa. The index is a composite of seven similarly constructed indexes including: new orders, production, supplier delivery times, backlogs, inventories, prices paid, and employment. New orders and orders backlog indices indicate future production activity. It signals factory-sector expansion when it is above 50 and contraction when below it. The index is seasonally adjusted for the effects of variations within the year, differences due to holidays and institutional changes. Because it is an opinion survey, it is often influenced by respondents’ perception of current events, as opposed to actual hard data. Also, it does not capture technological <br><br>and production changes, which make it possible for production to expand, while employment contracts. Because the Chicago PMI is released the day before the ISM, it is watched in order to predict the more important ISM report (the Chicago PMI has an impressive 91% correlation with the ISM national NAPM), which is in itself a good leading indicator of overall economic activity. It frequently moves markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>The Philadelphia Fed index, which is released on the third Thursday of the month (with data for the same month), was a distant second at 76%. Philly Fed's performance improved slightly to 78% when Briefing measured its results using the NAPM methodology. The Philly index as released is not a composite of its subindexes, as the NAPM is. Instead, the Philly Fed survey asks many questions, but the total index is based on the general question \\\"are business conditions better or worse than last month.\\\" It is often the case that a weighted measure of the individual questions on specifics such as new orders and production moves in a different direction than the index based on the general question. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe rest of the regional indexes fared poorly, ranging from correlations as poor as 55% (APICS) to 73% (Milwaukee). Chicago was the clear winner, but the Philly Fed index definitely deserves recognition, particularly since it is released so much earlier than the rest. In the future, then, we would recommend setting aside most of the regional manufacturing surveys and focussing on just Philly and Chicago, which offer the best hope of predicting the national index. And when you look at the Philly index, improve your chances by looking at the Philly numbers calculated on an NAPM basis, which Briefing will be happy to provide. \\r\\n\",\"eclong176\":\"Protocol of last interest rate meeting\",\"eclong1761158\":\" -  Retail Sales<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>Retail sales measure the total receipts at stores that sell durable and nondurable goods.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>With consumer spending a large part of the economy, market players continually monitor spending patterns.

The household survey is a survey of roughly 60,000 households. This survey produces the unemployment rate. The establishment survey is a survey of 375,000 businesses. This survey produces the nonfarm payrolls, average workweek, and average hourly earnings figures, to name a few. Both surveys cover the payroll period which includes the 12th of each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe reports both measure employment levels, just from different angles. Due to the vastly different size of the survey samples (the establishment survey not only surveys more businesses, but each business employs many individuals), the measures of employment may differ markedly from month to month. The household survey is used only for the unemployment measure - the market focusses primarily on the more comprehensive establishment survey. Together, these two surveys make up the employment report, the most timely and broad indicator of economic activity released each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nTotal payrolls are broken down into sectors such as manufacturing, mining, construction, services, and government. The markets follows these components closely as indicators of the trends in sectors of the economy; the manufacturing sector is watched the most closely as it often leads the business cycle. The data also include breakdowns of hours worked, overtime, and average hourly earnings. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe average workweek (also known as hours worked) is important for two reasons. First, it is a critical determinant of such monthly indicators as industrial production and personal income. Second, it is considered a useful indicator of labor market conditions: a rising workweek early in the business cycle may be the first indication that employers are preparing to boost their payrolls, while late in the cycle a rising workweek may indicate that employers are having difficulty finding qualified applicants for open positions. Average earnings are closely followed as an indicator of potential inflation. Like the price of any good or service, the price of labor reacts to an overly accommodative monetary policy. If the price of labor is rising sharply, it may be an indication that too much money is chasing too few goods, or in this case employees. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\"><b>In Depth</b></span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is really two reports - the household survey and the establishment survey. These two surveys contain a wealth of timely information which justify this report's status as the most important economic release of the month. This same wealth of information can nevertheless turn into a dearth of knowledge if it is not placed in the proper context. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Household and Establishment Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe household and establishment surveys differ due to the source of the data, as the names suggest. The household survey is a survey of households and the establishment survey is a surveys of businesses. The establishment survey, which is sometimes referred to as the payrolls survey, is favored by the market for a simple reason - it is far more comprehensive. Both surveys attempt to measure employment conditions at the roughly the same point in time - the household survey covers the calendar week which includes the 12th of the month while the establishment survey covers the pay period (be it a week, two weeks, or longer) which includes the 12th. But the establishment survey covers 390,000 businesses which employ 47 million people, while the household survey covers just 50,000 individuals. With a sample size which is 940 times larger than the household survey, it is hardly surprising that the market is more interested in the establishment survey. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAside from the sample size, the surveys differ in other significant ways. The household survey counts farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers as employed; the establishment survey does not. The household survey can only count one individual as employed once, even if that person holds two jobs. The establishment survey will double count an individual who appears on the payrolls of two companies. There are other, less significant differences, but let's turn now to the statistics produced by the two surveys. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Household Survey</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Unemployment Rate</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAs we noted earlier, the household survey is not nearly as reliable as the establishment survey due to the small size of the survey sample. This survey nevertheless receives attention, primarily because it is responsible for the one figure which is guaranteed to lead the nightly news - the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate demands little explanation, though it is worth noting that the rate can occasionally sees significant monthly changes which are due to flukes in the data.

These breakdowns seldom are of interest to the financial markets. Perhaps the only two exceptions are the discouraged worker and part-time worker measures. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Discouraged Workers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nDiscouraged workers are people who have dropped out of the labor force because they have become discouraged about their job prospects. During hard times, this statistic is often watched alongside the unemployment rate. If the job situation gets exceptionally bleak, it is possible to see the unemployment rate remaining stable not because people are finding jobs, but because they have given up looking and dropped out of the labor force. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Part-Time Workers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe issue of part time employment has arisen in recent years as many analysts have argued that strong payroll growth reflected the increase in the number of workers holding multiple part-time jobs. Since the payroll data do not differentiate between full and part-time workers, it is possible that a sudden surge in part-time employment which reflected poor full-time job prospects would actually boost payroll growth. In reality, it does not appear that this has happened, as part-time employment has been relatively steady in recent years. This figure nevertheless receives attention from time to time. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Big Picture</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nGiven the wealth of data contained in the employment report, it is important to take all of these indicators into account when passing judgment on the report. Looking at payrolls along is often misleading, as the workweek, earnings, and household employment measures may be telling a different story. Taken together, however, and taken with the caveats concerning monthly volatility and revisions, the employment report offers the best monthly glimpse of the economy.\\r\\n\",\"eclong186\":\"<br><br><span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Brief</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is actually two separate reports which are the results of two separate surveys. The household survey is a survey of roughly 60,000 households. This survey produces the unemployment rate. The establishment survey is a survey of 375,000 businesses. This survey produces the nonfarm payrolls, average workweek, and average hourly earnings figures, to name a few. Both surveys cover the payroll period which includes the 12th of each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe reports both measure employment levels, just from different angles. Due to the vastly different size of the survey samples (the establishment survey not only surveys more businesses, but each business employs many individuals), the measures of employment may differ markedly from month to month. The household survey is used only for the unemployment measure - the market focusses primarily on the more comprehensive establishment survey. Together, these two surveys make up the employment report, the most timely and broad indicator of economic activity released each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nTotal payrolls are broken down into sectors such as manufacturing, mining, construction, services, and government. The markets follows these components closely as indicators of the trends in sectors of the economy; the manufacturing sector is watched the most closely as it often leads the business cycle. The data also include breakdowns of hours worked, overtime, and average hourly earnings. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe average workweek (also known as hours worked) is important for two reasons. First, it is a critical determinant of such monthly indicators as industrial production and personal income. Second, it is considered a useful indicator of labor market conditions: a rising workweek early in the business cycle may be the first indication that employers are preparing to boost their payrolls, while late in the cycle a rising workweek may indicate that employers are having difficulty finding qualified applicants for open positions. Average earnings are closely followed as an indicator of potential inflation. Like the price of any good or service, the price of labor reacts to an overly accommodative monetary policy. If the price of labor is rising sharply, it may be an indication that too much money is chasing too few goods, or in this case employees. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Depth</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is really two reports - the household survey and the establishment survey. These two surveys contain a wealth of timely information which justify this report's status as the most important economic release of the month. This same wealth of information can nevertheless turn into a dearth of knowledge if it is not placed in the proper context. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Household and Establishment Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe household and establishment surveys differ due to the source of the data, as the names suggest. The household survey is a survey of households and the establishment survey is a surveys of businesses. The establishment survey, which is sometimes referred to as the payrolls survey, is favored by the market for a simple reason - it is far more comprehensive. Both surveys attempt to measure employment conditions at the roughly the same point in time - the household survey covers the calendar week which includes the 12th of the month while the establishment survey covers the pay period (be it a week, two weeks, or longer) which includes the 12th. But the establishment survey covers 390,000 businesses which employ 47 million people, while the household survey covers just 50,000 individuals. With a sample size which is 940 times larger than the household survey, it is hardly surprising that the market is more interested in the establishment survey. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAside from the sample size, the surveys differ in other significant ways. The household survey counts farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers as employed; the establishment survey does not. The household survey can only count one individual as employed once, even if that person holds two jobs. The establishment survey will double count an individual who appears on the payrolls of two companies. There are other, less significant differences, but let's turn now to the statistics produced by the two surveys. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Establishment Survey</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Nonfarm Payrolls</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nWithout question, the single most important piece of data contained in the employment report generally and the establishment survey specifically is nonfarm payrolls. As the name implies, nonfarm payrolls measure the number of people on the payrolls of all non-agricultural businesses. The monthly changes in payrolls can be quite volatile, occasionally varying by better than 200K from one month to the next. Even with this volatility and the possibility of large revisions to past data, the payrolls figures offer the most timely and comprehensive snapshot of the economy. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Average Workweek</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe workweek, also referred to as hours worked, is an often underrated indicator in the establishment survey. The average number of hours worked by employees on nonfarm payrolls is an important determinant of both industrial production and personal income in any given month. The workweek typically sees changes of a tenth or two each month, but can see much larger swings, such as the four tenth decline reported for October. To understand the importance of these changes in the workweek, note that a one tenth decline in the average workweek of 120 mln workers (roughly the current level of employment) results in 12 mln fewer hours worked. To create a similar decline in manhours through a change in employment, payrolls would have to fall 340K. For the purposes of production and income calculations, a one tenth of an hour change in the workweek is equivalent to a 340K change in employment. Needless to say, the workweek data are therefore critical in judging the overall strength or weakness of the employment report. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Aggregate Hours Worked</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe aggregate hours worked index simply brings together the two series we just noted. By calculating an index which looks at both employment and the workweek, we get a complete picture of the total hours worked each month. This indicator is seen as a monthly proxy for GDP. By definition, the quarterly change in the amount of goods produced is equal to the change in manhours plus the change in productivity. As productivity is somewhat predictable from quarter to quarter, the aggregate hours worked index provides a helpful monthly read on the overall economy. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Average Hourly Earnings</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe last indicator from the establishment survey which is worthy of close inspection is average hourly earnings, which is important for two reasons. Alongside total manhours, the average earnings figure gives us a good indication of personal income growth during the month. Second, the earnings figures are closely watched during periods of strong economic growth for evidence of increasing wage pressures. Such has certainly been the case over the past year, as the market's reaction to the employment data has often turned on the change in hourly earnings and its implications for the inflation outlook.\\r\\n\",\"eclong187\":\"House Prices\",\"eclong1871176\":\" -  PPI<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>The producer price index (PPI) is a measure of the average price level for a fixed basket of capital and consumer goods paid by producers.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The PPI measures prices at the producer level before they are passed along to consumers.

Unemployment rates calculated by the Bundesbank are preferred but some German analysts check the unadjusted rates as well. And then there are still different rates for unemployment that are used by Eurostat to compute their unemployment rate. The spread between the Bundesbank rates and Eurostat can be quite significant. For example, the July 2005 unemployment rate from the Bundesbank was 11.7 percent while that used by Eurostat to calculate EMU unemployment was 9.3 percent. The reason for the vast differential is found in the interpretation of the ILO <b>Definition</b><br/>. <br/><br/>Unlike in the U.S. no wage data are included in this report. But by tracking the jobs data, investors can sense the degree of tightness in the job market. If labor markets are tight, investors will be alert to possible inflationary pressures that could exist. If wage inflation threatens, it's a good bet that interest rates will rise; bond and stock prices will fall. No doubt that the only investors in a good mood will be the ones who watched the employment report and adjusted their portfolios to anticipate these events. In contrast, when job growth is slow or negative, then interest rates are likely to decline - boosting up bond and stock prices in the process.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly\",\"eclong190\":\"<br><br>Factory orders consist of the earlier announced durable goods report plus non-durable goods orders.

If the price of labor is rising sharply, it may be an indication that too much money is chasing too few goods, or in this case employees. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Depth</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is really two reports - the household survey and the establishment survey. These two surveys contain a wealth of timely information which justify this report's status as the most important economic release of the month. This same wealth of information can nevertheless turn into a dearth of knowledge if it is not placed in the proper context. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Household and Establishment Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe household and establishment surveys differ due to the source of the data, as the names suggest. The household survey is a survey of households and the establishment survey is a surveys of businesses. The establishment survey, which is sometimes referred to as the payrolls survey, is favored by the market for a simple reason - it is far more comprehensive. Both surveys attempt to measure employment conditions at the roughly the same point in time - the household survey covers the calendar week which includes the 12th of the month while the establishment survey covers the pay period (be it a week, two weeks, or longer) which includes the 12th. But the establishment survey covers 390,000 businesses which employ 47 million people, while the household survey covers just 50,000 individuals. With a sample size which is 940 times larger than the household survey, it is hardly surprising that the market is more interested in the establishment survey. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAside from the sample size, the surveys differ in other significant ways. The household survey counts farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers as employed; the establishment survey does not. The household survey can only count one individual as employed once, even if that person holds two jobs. The establishment survey will double count an individual who appears on the payrolls of two companies. There are other, less significant differences, but let's turn now to the statistics produced by the two surveys. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Establishment Survey</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Nonfarm Payrolls</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nWithout question, the single most important piece of data contained in the employment report generally and the establishment survey specifically is nonfarm payrolls. As the name implies, nonfarm payrolls measure the number of people on the payrolls of all non-agricultural businesses. The monthly changes in payrolls can be quite volatile, occasionally varying by better than 200K from one month to the next. Even with this volatility and the possibility of large revisions to past data, the payrolls figures offer the most timely and comprehensive snapshot of the economy. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Average Workweek</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe workweek, also referred to as hours worked, is an often underrated indicator in the establishment survey. The average number of hours worked by employees on nonfarm payrolls is an important determinant of both industrial production and personal income in any given month. The workweek typically sees changes of a tenth or two each month, but can see much larger swings, such as the four tenth decline reported for October. To understand the importance of these changes in the workweek, note that a one tenth decline in the average workweek of 120 mln workers (roughly the current level of employment) results in 12 mln fewer hours worked. To create a similar decline in manhours through a change in employment, payrolls would have to fall 340K. For the purposes of production and income calculations, a one tenth of an hour change in the workweek is equivalent to a 340K change in employment. Needless to say, the workweek data are therefore critical in judging the overall strength or weakness of the employment report. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Aggregate Hours Worked</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe aggregate hours worked index simply brings together the two series we just noted. By calculating an index which looks at both employment and the workweek, we get a complete picture of the total hours worked each month. This indicator is seen as a monthly proxy for GDP. By definition, the quarterly change in the amount of goods produced is equal to the change in manhours plus the change in productivity. As productivity is somewhat predictable from quarter to quarter, the aggregate hours worked index provides a helpful monthly read on the overall economy. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Average Hourly Earnings</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe last indicator from the establishment survey which is worthy of close inspection is average hourly earnings, which is important for two reasons. Alongside total manhours, the average earnings figure gives us a good indication of personal income growth during the month. Second, the earnings figures are closely watched during periods of strong economic growth for evidence of increasing wage pressures. Such has certainly been the case over the past year, as the market's reaction to the employment data has often turned on the change in hourly earnings and its implications for the inflation outlook.\\r\\n\",\"eclong1931185\":\" -  CPI<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>The Consumer Price Index is a measure of the average price level of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by consumers.

By tracking price pressures in the pipeline, investors can anticipate inflationary consequences in coming months. <br/><br/>While the CPI is the price index with the most impact in setting interest rates, the PPI provides significant information earlier in the production process. As a starting point, interest rates have an \\\"inflation premium\\\" and components for risk factors. A lender will want the money paid back from a loan to at least have the same purchasing power as when loaned. The interest rate at a minimum equals the inflation rate to maintain purchasing power and this generally is based on the CPI. Changes in inflation lead to changes in interest rates and, in turn, in equity prices.<br/><br/>The PPI is considered a precursor of both consumer price inflation and profits. If the prices paid to manufacturers increase, businesses are faced with either charging higher prices or they taking a cut in profits. The ability to pass along price increases depends on the strength and competitiveness of the marketplace.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly\",\"eclong198\":\"<br><br><b>ISM: Institute for Supply Management</b><br>\\r\\nformerly NAPM: National Association of Purchasing Managers\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Brief</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe ISM report is a national survey of purchasing managers which covers such indicators as new orders, production, employment, inventories, delivery times, prices, export orders, and import orders.

The survey queries respondents on a number of monthly indicators, including orders, production, employment, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, export orders, and import orders.

Therefore, the report is extremely predictable and of very little interest to the market. Though this series does have some predictive qualities, it is a common criticism that it has predicted \\\"nine of the last six\\\" recessions. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe Commerce Department previously published the leading indicators series. The collection and publishing of these data is now done by the non-profit Conference Board, which also produces the Consumer Confidence index. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Depth</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Purpose</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe purpose of the leading index is straightforward: It is designed to signal turning points in the business cycle. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Composition</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe index of leading indicators includes the ten economic statistics listed below.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<br>1. The interest rate spread between 10-year Treasury notes and the federal funds rate. \\r\\n<br>2. The inflation-adjusted, M2 measure of the money supply. \\r\\n<br>3. The average manufacturing workweek. \\r\\n<br>4. Manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. \\r\\n<br>5. The S&P 500 measure of stock prices. \\r\\n<br>6. The vendor performance component of the NAPM index. \\r\\n<br>7. The average level of weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance. \\r\\n<br>8. Building permits. \\r\\n<br>9. The University of Michigan index of consumer expectations. \\r\\n<br>10. Manufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe Conference Board, the organization that produces the leading index, standardizes these variables according to their individual weights in order to construct a composite leading index. Note that we have listed the components in order of importance. The difference between 10-year Treasuries and the fed funds rate carries the most weight; historically, this approximation of the slope of the yield curve has proven relatively more successful than other components at predicting future economic activity. Along those same lines, orders for nondefense capital goods carry the smallest weight because they have typically proven relatively poorer at pointing to changes in the direction of economic growth at large. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Performance</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe leading index receives plenty of criticism. Indeed, skeptics often joke that it has correctly signalled nine of the last six recessions. Meanwhile, in its literature, The Conference Board cites the lead times with which the leading index has correctly predicted economic downturns. It is thus fair to ask whether the leading index is useless or priceless. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe answer lies somewhere in between. The charge that the index predicts recessions that do not come to fruition--and fails to warn of those that do--is hardly a fair criticism. No forecaster, even armed with an arsenal of economic statistics, has a perfect track record when it comes to predicting recessions. It is therefore unreasonable to assume that a ten-component index can do any better. That said, the index does have some reliability problems. For example, it failed to turn down prior to the 1990-91 recession, and in 1995 it signalled a downturn that never came to pass. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Usefulness</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe leading index is more useful now that The Conference Board has taken control of it (the Department of Commerce stopped producing it at the end of 1996). Conference Board researchers quickly scrapped two of the old components--the change in sensitive materials prices and unfilled orders for durable goods--and added the interest-rate spread that appears in our list above. The index now lacks a wholesale price term, which some see as critical to determining future demand and inflation trends, but on net the new index emits less pronounced false signals and does a better job than it used to. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nBriefing finds the leading index most helpful when we can make a statement like this: The leading index has decreased only once during the past year. Of course, even a strong trend like that does not guarantee that a recession will not form over the coming six to nine months. But we can get additional help from looking at the leading index with the coincident index, which is also published by The Conference Board, and alongside a couple of other leading indices published by Columbia University. Indeed, there exists much research that deals with the criteria for determining recession warnings (i.e., the leading index must fall during four of seven months and the coincident index must fall for three straight months). \\r\\n\",\"eclong200\":\"<br><br><b>ISM: Institute for Supply Management</b><br>\\r\\nformerly NAPM: National Association of Purchasing Managers\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Brief</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe ISM report is a national survey of purchasing managers which covers such indicators as new orders, production, employment, inventories, delivery times, prices, export orders, and import orders.

And finally, the 42.7% mark on the total index marks the point below which the overall economy is believed to be in recession. Between 42.7-50%, the manufacturing sector may be in decline, but the total economy is only seeing slower growth. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>No Services</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThis observation highlights the important element which is missing from the ISM index - the service sector. With the manufacturing sector making up an ever-shrinking percentage of the total economy - the ISM might seem to be an indicator in decline. Not so, however - the manufacturing sector, while shrinking in relative terms, still tends to lead the total economy into and out of recessions. The ISM therefore remains a closely watched indicator despite its manufacturing focus. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>A Proven Performer</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe ISM's leading quality has been proven over time. Its bottom during a recession has preceded the turning point for the business cycle by an average of four months, and its worst performance in leading the turning point was on two occasions when the ISM trough occurred in the same month as the business cycle trough. The ISM index is released on the first business day of each at 10:00 ET, with data for the prior calendar month.\\r\\n<br><br>\",\"eclong2001198\":\" -  Retail Sales<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>Retail sales measure the total receipts at stores that sell durable and nondurable goods.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>With consumer spending a large part of the economy, market players continually monitor spending patterns.

The focus on money supply has long since been abandoned, however. To the extent that money supply is still monitored by the market, M2 is the favored monetary aggregate. The Fed still targets both M2 and M3 in a rhetorical sense, but these targets mean little when it comes to policy decisions. If the Fed misses its target, it is more likely to change the target than it is to change policy. In 2000, the Fed finally abandoned the targets altogether, thereby removing any remaining emphasis on this one-time star release.<br><br><b>In Depth</b>Though money supply measures were long ago relegated to the bottom of the Fed's list of policy tools, they are still useful in providing clues regarding the strength of the economy. This article offers a refresher on just what the monetary aggregates are - how they are constructed, why they matter, and how much the Fed cares about each. Let's start with the strict definitions.<br><br>M1, the narrowest of the monetary aggregates, contains the following:<br>1. Currency, except that held by the Fed, Treasury, or banks/thrifts 2. Travelers checks 3. Demand deposits (non-interest bearing checking accounts), except those due to banks, the government, or foreign institutions 4. Other checkable deposits - most notably NOW (negotiable order of withdrawal) accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>M2, the aggregate which the Fed watches most closely, contains the following:<br>1. M1<br>2. Savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts- MMDAs) \\r\\n<br>3. Time deposits (known commonly as CDs or certificates of deposit) in denominations of less than $100,000 \\r\\n<br>4. Balances in retail money market funds (retail funds have minimum initial investments of less than $50,000) <br><br>Finally, M3 - the broadest aggregate - contains:<br>\\r\\n1. M2 \\r\\n<br>2. Time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more \\r\\n<br>3. Balances in institutional money market funds (minimum investments of more than $50,000) \\r\\n<br>4. Overnight and term repurchase agreements \\r\\n<br>5. Overnight and term eurodollars held by U.S. residents\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<u>The Decline of M1</u><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, M1 was directly targetted by the Federal Reserve, and its weekly release was of critical importance to the financial markets. Today, M1 is barely noticed, and its stock continues to decline. The reason for M1's demise as a useful indicator is financial deregulation, which enabled individuals to hold transaction balances in accounts such as MMDAs which were not included in M1. More recently, M1 has lost what little usefulness it had left as sweep accounts have undermined the narrow aggregate. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><u>Sweeps-stakes</u>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>Sweep accounts are a hybrid checking account/savings account. In a typical sweep account, banks will sweep part of a NOW account's balance into an MMDA. As funds are needed to cover checks written against the NOW account, the bank will periodically shift funds from the MMDA back into the NOW account. Since the legal maximum number of withdrawals from an MMDA is six per month, all funds will be shifted back to the NOW account on the sixth transaction of the month. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br>Sweep accounts benefit both banks and depositors. Banks benefit because MMDAs do not require any reserves to be held with the Fed, while NOW accounts are reservable. As these required reserves are non-interest bearing, banks benefit by reducing their level of required reserves. Depositors benefit because MMDAs carry higher interest rates, and thus earnings on checking balances are increased. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br>As NOW accounts are in M1 and MMDAs are in M2, M1 has been dramatically weakened by sweeps, while M2 has not been affected (since M2 already includes M1, a shift from a NOW account to an MMDA has no impact on M2). \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<u>The Rise and Fall and Rise of M2</u>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>M2 is the most closely watched monetary aggregate - both by economists and the Federal Reserve. The 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act mandated that the Fed set annual targets for money supply and that the Fed Chairman report to Congress twice each year regarding these targets. The Fed used to take that responsibility quite seriously - setting point targets for M1 growth, and later setting target ranges for M2 and M3. Finally, in 2000, the Fed abandoned these money targetting altogether. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>he reduced emphasis on M2 first became evident in the late 1980s but was sealed in the early 1990s. M2 is a useful indicator only so long as its velocity (the rate of turnover of a dollar of M2, or mathematically, nominal GDP divided by M2) is stable over the long term. Unfortunately, the long term stability of M2 velocity, which was at the core of monetarism, disappeared beginning in the late 1980s. Banks and thrifts, devastated by nonperforming assets, pulled back from their traditional lending business, with market financing sources picking up the slack. The result was a break from the long term trend in M2 velocity. Suddenly, one dollar of M2 could fund far more nominal GDP growth, as market financing increased the efficiency of the financial system. Regardless of the hows and whys - which are still debated by economists - the bottom line was that M2 was no longer a reliable indicator. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br>It will take many years of predictable velocity before the Fed once again places much emphasis on M2 in its policy deliberations. And it is safe to say that neither M2 nor any other monetary aggregate will occupy the top spot in policy making as M1 did in the early 1980s. The record of interest rate targetting has simply been much better than that of money targetting. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<u>M3: Still Bringing Up the Rear</u>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>M3 attracts more attention than it did previously, due largely to the demise of M1, but its inclusion of institutional accounts makes it less attractive than M2, which focusses on individual deposit accounts. The bottom line in determining which aggregate receives the most attention is the relative stability of its velocity. Even though M2 velocity went off course in the early 1990s, it has still been the most predictable of the three during the postwar period. \\r\\n\",\"eclong215\":\"<br><br>This survey measures the level of confidence individual households have in the performance of the economy now and in the future. It is a leading indicator of future spending and the business cycle. 5000 consumers in the nine census divisions across the country are surveyed each month. The level of consumer confidence is directly correlated to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy. It also correlates closely with joblessness, inflation, and real incomes. The report can occasionally be helpful in predicting sudden shifts in consumption patterns, though most small changes in the index are just noise. Only index changes of at least five points should be considered significant. The index consists of two subindexes - consumers' appraisal of current conditions and their expectations for the future. Expectations make up 60% of the total index, with current conditions accounting for the other 40%. The expectations index is typically seen as having better leading indicator qualities than the current conditions index. The more confident consumers are about the economy and their own personal finances, the more likely they are to spend. Note, changes in consumer confidence and retail sales do not move in tandem month by month. If the economy experiences a long-term expansion, buying intentions may decline even while the jobless rate declines because of the satisfaction of pent-up demand. Conversely, if inflation begins to accelerate, spending plans may increase for the short-term as consumers buy now to avoid having to pay higher prices later. Regional differences in consumer confidence are an indication of differing business cycles across the nation. This has implications for spending on durable goods and, more importantly, for residential real estate markets. Financial markets interpret rising consumer confidence as a precursor to higher consumer spending. Higher consumer spending could in turn spark inflation. Look for a change in the direction of the six month moving average of the index. Consumers do not usually have the necessary information to accurately assess income and job growth six months in the future. The report provides information on planned spending, which does not necessarily turn into actual spending, although it is unlikely that increasing consumer confidence would be followed by a decline in spending. The Consumer Confidence survey is not useful for any type of forecasting.\\r\\n\",\"eclong216\":\"European Central Bank Publishes Monthly Report\",\"eclong217\":\"House Prices\",\"eclong218\":\"House Prices\",\"eclong219\":\"<br><br>The index of Industrial Production is a fixed-weight measure of the physical output of the nation's factories, mines, and utilities.

Though the rate of capacity utilization is seen as a critical gauge of the slack available in the economy, the market does not completely trust this measure.

One can therefore predict the capacity utilization rate quite accurately based on the assumption for production growth.

For example, if inventory growth lags sales growth, then manufacturers will have to boost production lest commodity shortages occur.

Changes in consumer credit indicate the state of consumer finances and portend future spending patterns.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Growth in consumer credit can hold positive or negative implications for the economy and markets. Economic activity is stimulated when consumers borrow within their means to buy cars and other major purchases. On the other hand, if consumers pile up too much debt relative to their income levels, they may have to stop spending on new goods and services just to pay off old debts. That could put a big dent in economic growth.<br/><br/>The demand for credit also has a direct bearing on interest rates. If the demand to borrow money exceeds the supply of willing lenders, interest rates rise. If credit demand falls and many willing lenders are fighting for customers, they may offer lower interest rates to attract business.<br/><br/>Financial market players focus less attention on this indicator because it is reported with a long lag relative to other consumer information. Long term investors who do pay attention to this report will have a greater understanding of consumer spending ability. This will give them a lead on investment alternatives.

The BEA reports several measures of profits. Profits from current production (corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment), are also known as operating or \\\"economic\\\" profits. Capital consumption adjustment deals with the differences in depreciation allowances used for accounting and income tax purposes. Inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) deals with the difference in measuring the cost of inventory replacement. Book profits amount to operating profits subtracting out inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments. After tax profits are book profits after taxes are subtracted. The Econoday reports will focus on after tax profits reported by the BEA, since these are the most relevant.<br/><br/>The corporate profit figures that are derived from the national income and product accounts (NIPA) depend on GDP growth. They don't always move in the same direction or the same magnitude as the profit data reported directly by individual companies or even the S&P 500.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Corporate profits are the lifeblood of investment spending. Profits are the income of a corporation. When profits are strong, then companies will be able to increase their capital spending. This could allow better growth prospects for a company and is likely to increase its underlying value. When corporate profits decline, then capital spending tends to decline. Without the potential for growth, a company could be at a disadvantage, particularly in our global economic environment.<br/><br/>Corporate profits also reveal the health of an organization. When a company's profits are anemic during economic expansion, it suggests that the company is not performing efficiently. The value of an inefficient company is determined by its stock price. Thus weak profits signal lower stock prices. When a company's profits are relatively strong, even during an economic downturn, it usually means that the organization is well-managed.

All urban consumers are a more inclusive group, representing about 87 percent of the population. The CPI-U is the more widely quoted of the two, although cost-of-living contracts for unions and Social Security benefits are usually tied to the CPI-W, because it has a longer history. Monthly variations between the two are slight.<br/><br/>The CPI is also available by size of city, by region of the country, for cross-classifications of regions and population-size classes, and for many metropolitan areas. The regional and city CPIs are often used in local contracts.<br/><br/>The Bureau of Labor Statistics also produces a chain-weighted index called the Chained CPI. This measures a variable basket of goods and services whereas the regular CPI-U and CPI-W measure a fixed basket of goods and services. The Chained CPI is similar to the personal consumption expenditure deflator that is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve Board.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The consumer price index is the most widely followed monthly indicator of inflation. An investor who understands how inflation influences the markets will benefit over those investors that do not understand the impact.<br/><br/>Inflation is an increase in the overall prices of goods and services. The relationship between inflation and interest rates is the key to understanding how indicators such as the CPI influence the markets- and your investments.<br/><br/>If someone borrows $100 dollars from you today and promises to repay it in one year with interest, how much interest should you charge? The answer depends largely on inflation as you know the $100 will not be able to buy the same amount of goods and services a year from now. The CPI tells us that prices rose 4.2 percent in the U.S. over 2007. To recoup your purchasing power, you would have to charge 4.2 percent interest. You might want to add one or two percentage points to cover default and other risks, but inflation remains the key factor behind the interest rate you charge.<br/><br/>Inflation (along with various risks) basically explains how interest rates are set on everything from your mortgage and auto loans to Treasury bills, notes and bonds. As the rate of inflation changes and as expectations on inflation change, the markets adjust interest rates. The effect ripples across stocks, bonds, commodities, and your portfolio, often in a dramatic fashion.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/>The consumer price index is the most widely followed monthly indicator of inflation. The CPI is considered a cost-of-living measure since it is used to adjust contracts of all types that are tied to inflation. Labor contracts are tied to changes in the CPI; Social Security payments are tied to the CPI; and even tax brackets are tied to the consumer price index.<br/><br/>For monetary policy, the Federal Reserve generally follows \\\"headline\\\" and \\\"core\\\" inflation. This latter measure excludes the volatile food and energy components. The Fed's preferred inflation measure is not the CPI but the personal consumption price index because it reflects what consumers are actually buying during any given period-the component weights are updated annually while those for the CPI are updated infrequently. However, the subcomponent price data of the CPI are used to compile the PCE price index (PCE prices are released almost two weeks after the CPI). Thus, the CPI and the PCE price index are inextricably linked. In the long run, the overall CPI and core CPI track each other.<br/><br/>Interpretation<br/>The bond market will rally (fall) when increases in the CPI are small (large). The equity market rallies with the bond market because low inflation promises low interest rates and is good for profits.<br/><br/>Economic data tends to be volatile from month to month; the CPI is no exception. Large fluctuations in the consumer price index are often due to the food and energy components. Weather conditions affect both to a large extent. OPEC, the oil cartel, also affects energy prices. As a result, economists and financial market participants prefer to monitor the CPI excluding food and energy prices for its greater monthly stability. This is also referred to as the \\\"core\\\" CPI. Oddly enough, items that make part of the \\\"core\\\" also include discretionary goods and services. And while food and energy prices are excluded because of their monthly volatility, what can be more \\\"core\\\" than food and energy? Food and energy prices account for a little more than one-fifth of the CPI.<br/><br/>The consumer price index has evolved over time as consumer expenditures changed. Commodities now make up only 40 percent of the index and the remaining 60 percent are services. It is useful to monitor goods and services separately since prices of goods are more volatile than prices of services.<br/><br/>Usually, when investors refer to the real rate of interest, they use the year-over-year rise in the CPI to subtract from an interest rate, such as the 10-year Treasury note. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from June 2004 to June 2005; the 10-year Treasury note averaged 4.0 percent in June 2005.

Fed officials constantly monitor this data watching for even the smallest signs of potential inflationary pressures, even when economic conditions are soggy.

No doubt that the only investors in a good mood will be the ones who watched the employment report and adjusted their portfolios to anticipate these events. In contrast, when job growth is slow or negative, then interest rates are likely to decline - boosting up bond and stock prices in the process.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/>The employment situation is the primary monthly indicator of aggregate economic activity because it encompasses all major sectors of the economy. It is comprehensive and available early in the month. Many other economic indicators are dependent upon its information. It not only reveals information about the labor market, but about income and production as well. In short, it provides clues about other economic indicators reported for the month and plays a big role in influencing financial market psychology during the month.<br/><br/>Interpretation<br/>The bond market will rally (fall) when the employment situation shows weakness (strength). The equity market often rallies with the bond market on weak data because low interest rates are good for stocks. But sometimes the two markets move in opposite directions. After all, a healthy labor market should be favorable for the stock market because it supports economic growth and corporate profits. At the same time, bond traders are more concerned about the potential for inflationary pressures.<br/><br/>The unemployment rate rises during cyclical downturns and falls during periods of rapid economic growth. A rising unemployment rate is associated with a weak or contracting economy and declining interest rates. Conversely, a decreasing unemployment rate is associated with an expanding economy and potentially rising interest rates. The fear is that wages will accelerate if the unemployment rate becomes too low and workers are hard to find.<br/><br/>Nonfarm payroll employment indicates the current level of economic activity. Increases in nonfarm payrolls translate into earnings that workers will spend on goods and services in the economy. The greater the increases in employment, the faster the total economic growth. When the economy is in the mature phase of an expansion, rapid increases in employment cause fears of inflationary pressures if rapid demand for goods and services can't be met by current production.<br/><br/>When the average workweek trends up, it supports production gains in the current period and portends additional employment increases. When the average workweek is in a declining mode, it probably is signaling a potential slowdown in employment growth-or even outright declines in employment in case of recession.<br/><br/>Gains in average hourly earnings represent wage pressures. It is worth noting that these figures aren't adjusted for overtime pay or shifts in the composition of the workforce, which affects wages on its own. Market participants believe that a rising trend in hourly earnings will lead to higher inflation. But if increased wages are matched by productivity gains, producers won't increase product prices with wages because their unit labor costs are stable. <br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly.<br/><br/><b>Source</b><br/>Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Department of Labor.<br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>Usually the first Friday day of the month.<br/><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/>Data are for the previous month.

Taking bread as an example, several different types of bread are priced (e.g. large white loaves (sliced and unsliced), small brown loaf, large wholemeal loaf, bread rolls, pitta bread and french stick/baguette). These are considered as representative of the majority of bread consumption by most households. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nEach price collector collects the price of a representative item (e.g. brand) for that price indicator in January and exactly the same item/ brand must be priced every month for a period of thirteen months.

This report is entitled Agricultural Prices. Prices received represent sales from producers to first buyers. They include all grades and qualities. For most items, the current month's preliminary price represents a 3-5 day period around the 15th of the month. However, previous month's prices (revised) cover the entire month. The index is not adjusted for seasonal variation. It includes crop prices and livestock & product prices. Farm prices are monitored by analysts to give early warnings of inflation or deflationary pressures in the economy.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Farm prices are a leading indicator of food price changes in the producer and consumer price indices. There is not a one-to-one correlation, but general trends move in tandem. Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services. The relationship between inflation and interest rates is the key to understanding how data like farm prices can influence the markets (and your investments.)<br/><br/>If someone borrows $100 dollars from you today and promises to repay it in one year with interest, how much interest should you charge? The answer depends largely on inflation, because you know that the $100 won't be able to buy the same amount of goods and services a year from now, as it does today. If the CPI shows that prices are rising about 2% a year, then you need to charge 2% interest just to recoup your purchasing power at the end of the year. You might want to add in a few more percentage points for default risk and the opportunity cost, but the key variable in what interest rate you charge is the rate of inflation.<br/><br/>That basically explains how interest rates are set on everything from your mortgage and auto loans to Treasury bonds and T-bills. As the rate of inflation changes and as expectations on inflation change, the markets adjust interest rates accordingly. The effect ripples across stocks, bonds, commodities, and your portfolio, often in a dramatic fashion.<br/><br/>By tracking the trends in inflation (including farm prices), whether high or low, rising or falling, investors can anticipate how different types of investments will perform.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly.<br/><br/><b>Source</b><br/>National Agricultural Statistics Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture<br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>Last week of the month.<br/><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/>Data are for the current month.

For monetary policy, the FOMC evaluates the relative concerns over the outlook for economic growth (too strong, too weak, about right) and pending inflation (too high, too low, about right). The FOMC then determines whether short-term interest rates should be raised, lowered, or left unchanged to accomplish its objectives of healthy economic growth and low inflation. The FOMC consists of the seven Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (assuming no seats are vacant) and five Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The New York Fed president is always on the FOMC and the other four seats for the District presidents are rotated yearly. Changes in monetary policy are now announced immediately after FOMC meetings.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The Fed determines interest rate policy at FOMC meetings. These occur roughly every six weeks and are the single most influential event for the markets. For weeks in advance, market participants speculate about the possibility of an interest rate change at these meetings. If the outcome is different from expectations, the impact on the markets can be dramatic and far-reaching.<br/><br/>The interest rate set by the Fed, the federal funds rate, serves as a benchmark for all other rates. A change in the fed funds rate, the lending rate banks charge each other for the use of overnight funds, translates directly through to all other interest rates from Treasury bonds to mortgage loans.

Higher interest rates tend to slow economic activity; lower interest rates stimulate economic activity. Either way, interest rates influence the sales environment. In the consumer sector, few homes or cars will be purchased when interest rates rise.

It now discloses policy changes at the end of each meeting. Historically, the Fed used to keep investors guessing about policy changes and Fed officials did not appear on the speaking circuit as frequently as they do now.<br/><br/>Since the Fed moved up the release of the minutes to three weeks after a meeting from six in January 2005, the minutes have become a market mover as analysts parse each word looking for clues to policy. However, the minutes do include the complete economic analysis compiled by Fed officials and whether or not any FOMC members have voiced opinions at odds with the rest of the group.<br/><br/>Also, the FOMC minutes now include quarterly economic forecasts by the Fed. On November 20, 2007, the Federal Reserve changed its policy of how frequently and when it would release its forecasts. The Fed will now releases economic projections four times a year (every other FOMC meeting). Projections made by members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents will be published with the minutes of the FOMC meetings scheduled for January, April, June, and October. The forecasts released at the end of January and at the end of June become part of the Fed's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress. The quarterly forecasts can be market movers.<br/><br/>Investors who want a more detailed description of Fed opinions will generally read the minutes closely.

By tracking economic data such as the index of leading indicators, investors will know what the economic backdrop is for the various markets. The stock market likes to see healthy economic growth because that translates to higher corporate profits. The bond market prefers less rapid growth and is extremely sensitive to whether the economy is growing too quickly-and causing potential inflationary pressures. The index of leading indicators is designed to predict turning points in the economy -- such as recessions and recoveries. More specifically, it was designed to lead the index of coincident indicators, also now published by The Conference Board. Investors like to see composite indexes because they tell an easy story, although they are not always as useful as they promise. The majority of the components of the leading indicators have been reported earlier in the month so that the composite index doesn't necessarily reveal new information about the economy. Bond investors tend to be less interested in this index than equity investors. Also, the non-financial media tends to give this index more press than it deserves. <br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly<br/><br/><b>Source</b><br/>The Conference Board.<br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>Third week of the month.<br/><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/>Data are for the previous month.

It is available nationally by export, import and trade balance. Merchandise trade is available by export, import and trade balance for six principal end-use commodity categories and for more than one hundred principal Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) system commodity groupings. Data are also available for 36 countries and geographic regions. Detailed information is reported on oil and motor vehicle imports. Services trade is available by export, import and trade balance for seven principal end-use categories.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Changes in the level of imports and exports, along with the difference between the two (the trade balance) are a valuable gauge of economic trends here and abroad. While these trade figures can directly impact all financial markets, they primarily affect the value of the dollar in the foreign exchange market.<br/><br/>Imports indicate demand for foreign goods and services here in the U.S. Exports show the demand for U.S. goods in countries overseas. The dollar can be particularly sensitive to changes in the chronic trade deficit run by the United States, since this trade imbalance creates greater demand for foreign currencies. The bond market is also sensitive to the risk of importing inflation. This report gives a breakdown of U.S. trade with major countries as well, so it can be instructive for investors who are interested in diversifying globally. For example, a trend of accelerating exports to a particular country might signal economic strength and investment opportunities in that country.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/>The international trade balance on goods and services is the major indicator for foreign trade. While the trade balance (deficit) is small relative to the size of the economy (although it has increased over the years), changes in the trade balance can be quite substantial relative to changes in economic output from one quarter to the next. Measured separately, inflation-adjusted imports and exports are important components of aggregate economic activity, representing approximately 17 and 12 percent of real GDP, respectively.<br/><br/>Interpretation<br/>Market reaction to this report is complex. Typically, the smaller the trade deficit, the more bullish for the dollar. Also, stronger exports are bullish for corporate earnings and the stock market.<br/><br/>Both the level and changes in the level of international trade indicate relevant information about the trends in foreign trade. Like most economic indicators, the trade balance is subject to substantial monthly variability, especially when oil prices change. It is more appropriate to follow either three-month or 12-month moving averages of the monthly levels.<br/><br/>It is also useful to examine the trend growth rates for exports and imports separately because they can deviate significantly. Trends in export activity reflect both the competitive position of American industry and the strength of domestic and foreign economic activity. U.S. exports will grow when: 1) U.S. product prices are lower than foreign product prices; 2) the value of the dollar is relatively weaker than that of foreign currencies; 3) foreign economies are growing rapidly.<br/><br/>Imports will increase when: 1) foreign product prices are lower than prices of domestically-produced goods; 2) the value of the dollar is stronger than that of other currencies; 3) domestic demand for goods and services is robust.<br/><br/>The international trade report does show bilateral trade balances with our major trading partners. Since the value of the dollar versus various foreign currencies does not always move in tandem, we can see a narrower or wider trade deficit with different countries. In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan often caused political problems. In the 2000s, the trade deficit with Japan is now smaller, but the U.S. trade deficit with China is growing rapidly. While American consumers benefit from weak imports, American workers often lose their jobs as these goods are no longer produced in the United States. Ideally, the United States would be exporting (high end) goods that other countries don't produce. <br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly.<br/><br/><b>Source</b><br/>Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of the Census; U.S. Department of Commerce.<br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>Usually mid-month.<br/><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/> Data are for two months back.

The major groupings are comprised of final products (such as consumer goods, business equipment and construction supplies), intermediate products and materials. The industry groupings are manufacturing (further subdivided into durable and nondurable goods), mining and utilities. The capacity utilization rate -- reflecting the re<b>Source</b><br/> utilization of the nation's output facilities -- is available for the same market and industry groupings.<br/><br/>Industrial production was also revised to NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) in the early 2000s. Unlike other economic series that lost much historical data prior to 1992, the Federal Reserve Board was able to reconstruction historical data that go back more than 30 years.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Investors want to keep their finger on the pulse of the economy because it usually dictates how various types of investments will perform. The stock market likes to see healthy economic growth because that translates to higher corporate profits. The bond market prefers more subdued growth that won't lead to inflationary pressures. By tracking economic data such as industrial production, investors will know what the economic backdrop is for these markets and their portfolios.<br/><br/>The index of industrial production shows how much factories, mines and utilities are producing. The manufacturing sector accounts for less than 20 percent of the economy, but most of its cyclical variation. Consequently, this report has a big influence on market behavior. In any given month, one can see whether capital goods or consumer goods are growing more rapidly. Are manufacturers still producing construction supplies and other materials? This detailed report shows which sectors of the economy are growing and which are not.<br/><br/>The capacity utilization rate provides an estimate of how much factory capacity is in use. If the utilization rate gets too high (above 85 percent), it can lead to inflationary bottlenecks in production. The Federal Reserve watches this report closely and sets interest rate policy on the basis of whether production constraints are threatening to cause inflationary pressures. As such, the bond market can be highly sensitive to changes in the capacity utilization rate. In this global environment, though, global capacity constraints may matter as much as domestic capacity constraints.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/>Industrial production and capacity utilization indicate not only trends in the manufacturing sector, but also whether re<b>Source</b><br/> utilization is strained enough to forebode inflation. Also, industrial production is an important measure of current output for the economy and helps to define turning points in the business cycle (start of recession and start of recovery).<br/><br/>Interpretation<br/>The bond market will rally with slower production and a lower utilization rate. Bond prices will fall when production is robust and the capacity utilization rate suggests supply bottlenecks. Healthy production growth is bullish for the stock market only if it isn't accompanied by indications of inflationary pressures.<br/><br/>The production of services may have gained prominence in the United States, but the production of manufactured goods remains a key to the economic business cycle.

The major groupings are comprised of final products (such as consumer goods, business equipment and construction supplies), intermediate products and materials. The industry groupings are manufacturing (further subdivided into durable and nondurable goods), mining and utilities. The capacity utilization rate -- reflecting the re<b>Source</b><br/> utilization of the nation's output facilities -- is available for the same market and industry groupings.<br/><br/>Industrial production was also revised to NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) in the early 2000s. Unlike other economic series that lost much historical data prior to 1992, the Federal Reserve Board was able to reconstruction historical data that go back more than 30 years.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Investors want to keep their finger on the pulse of the economy because it usually dictates how various types of investments will perform. The stock market likes to see healthy economic growth because that translates to higher corporate profits. The bond market prefers more subdued growth that won't lead to inflationary pressures. By tracking economic data such as industrial production, investors will know what the economic backdrop is for these markets and their portfolios.<br/><br/>The index of industrial production shows how much factories, mines and utilities are producing. The manufacturing sector accounts for less than 20 percent of the economy, but most of its cyclical variation. Consequently, this report has a big influence on market behavior. In any given month, one can see whether capital goods or consumer goods are growing more rapidly. Are manufacturers still producing construction supplies and other materials? This detailed report shows which sectors of the economy are growing and which are not.<br/><br/>The capacity utilization rate provides an estimate of how much factory capacity is in use. If the utilization rate gets too high (above 85 percent), it can lead to inflationary bottlenecks in production. The Federal Reserve watches this report closely and sets interest rate policy on the basis of whether production constraints are threatening to cause inflationary pressures. As such, the bond market can be highly sensitive to changes in the capacity utilization rate. In this global environment, though, global capacity constraints may matter as much as domestic capacity constraints.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/>Industrial production and capacity utilization indicate not only trends in the manufacturing sector, but also whether re<b>Source</b><br/> utilization is strained enough to forebode inflation. Also, industrial production is an important measure of current output for the economy and helps to define turning points in the business cycle (start of recession and start of recovery).<br/><br/>Interpretation<br/>The bond market will rally with slower production and a lower utilization rate. Bond prices will fall when production is robust and the capacity utilization rate suggests supply bottlenecks. Healthy production growth is bullish for the stock market only if it isn't accompanied by indications of inflationary pressures.<br/><br/>The production of services may have gained prominence in the United States, but the production of manufactured goods remains a key to the economic business cycle.

The monetary aggregates (known individually as M1, M2, and M3) used to be all the rage when the Fed did not publicly announce it interest rate target because the data revealed the Fed's (tight or loose) hold on credit conditions in the economy. The Fed in the past issued target ranges for money supply growth at its first report to Congress each year. In the past, if actual growth moved outside those ranges it often was a prelude to an interest rate move from the Fed. Today, the Fed no longer sets money supply targets due to a variety of changes in the financial system and the way the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy. Monetary policy is understood more clearly by the level of the federal funds rate.<br/><br/>But with the Fed cutting the fed funds rate to essentially zero in December 2008, markets began to look for other ways (other than rate changes) for viewing the progress and impact of quantitative easing - and tracking the money supply became one of numerous methods of seeing how the Fed's further injections of liquidity were filtering through the economy.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/> <br/>This indicator has had low importance during the Fed's publicly announced interest rate targeting period but has gained a little more stature during quantitative easing since the fed funds rate has been at essentially zero.<br/><br/>Interpretation <br/>Markets focus on measures of money supply that are relatively liquid - M1 and M2.

Personal contributions for social insurance are subtracted from personal income.<br/><br/>Personal consumption expenditures are the major portion of personal outlays, which also include personal interest payments and transfer payments. Personal consumption expenditures are divided into durable goods, nondurable goods and services.

Economic performance is more appropriately measured after the effects of inflation are removed.<br/><br/>Each month, the Bureau of Economic Analysis also compiles the personal consumption expenditure price index, also known as the PCE price index. This inflation index measures a basket of goods and services that is updated annually in contrast to the CPI, which measures a fixed basket.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The income and outlays data are another handy way to gauge the strength of the consumer sector in this economy and where it is headed. Income gives households the power to spend and/or save. Spending greases the wheels of the economy and keeps it growing. Savings are often invested in the financial markets and can drive up the prices of stocks and bonds. Even if savings simply go into a bank account, part of those funds typically is used by the bank for lending and therefore contributes to economic activity. In the past twenty years, the personal saving rate has diminished rapidly as consumers have spent a greater and greater share of their income. But that has reversed in part during the recession that began in 2008 as consumers have cut back on credit card use and have been rebuilding retirement accounts.<br/><br/>The consumption (outlays) part of this report is even more directly tied to the economy, which we know usually dictates how the markets perform. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, so if you know what consumers are up to, you'll have a pretty good handle on where the economy is headed. Investors can see how consumers are directing their spending, whether they are buying durable goods, nondurable goods or services. Needless to say, that's a big advantage for investors who determine which companies' shares they will buy.<br/><br/><b>Importance</b><br/>Income is the major determinant of spending -- U.S. consumers spend roughly 95 cents of each new dollar. Consumer spending accounts directly for more than two-thirds of overall economic activity and indirectly influences capital spending, inventory investment and imports.<br/><br/>Interpretation<br/>Increases (decreases) in income and consumption cause bond prices to fall (rally). As long as spending isn't inflationary, the stock market benefits because greater spending spurs corporate profits. Financial market participants pay somewhat less attention to personal consumption expenditures than to retail sales, which are released earlier in the month. However, they do closely monitor personal income and the PCE deflator.<br/><br/>Changes in personal income signal changes in consumer spending. For instance, a period of rapid income growth may signal future gains in personal consumption expenditures as well. Conversely, a period of declining income growth could signal an impending recession. While consumers often still must purchase necessities, discretionary purchases may decline, or moderate.<br/><br/>Consumers are more likely to increase spending when they see their stock portfolios increase in tandem with the stock market. When the stock market falls, spending is likely to decline because consumers feel less wealthy. Home prices and home equity have similar effects. Rising home prices boost the amount of equity consumers have in their homes. This allows access to Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) accounts. Plus consumers feel wealthier whether they have a HELOC account or not. When home prices decline, home equity falls and cuts into consumer spending.<br/><br/>Personal income is a comprehensive figure, but also incorporates taxes consumers must pay. By removing personal tax payments from personal income, we are left with disposable income. This is what consumers have left to spend on goods and services.

By tracking economic data such as the Philly Fed survey, investors will know what the economic backdrop is for the various markets. The stock market likes to see healthy economic growth because that translates to higher corporate profits. The bond market prefers more moderate growth so that it won't lead to inflation. The Philly Fed survey gives a detailed look at the manufacturing sector, how busy it is and where things are headed. Since manufacturing is a major sector of the economy, this report has a big influence on market behavior. Some of the Philly Fed sub-indexes also provide insight on commodity prices and other clues on inflation.

Readings above 50 percent indicate an expanding business sector.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The official name of this report is ISM - Chicago although it is commonly referred to as the Chicago PMI. ISM stands for Institute for Supply Management while PMI is shorthand for purchasing managers' index. The traditional name goes back to the years when the ISM was called the National Association of Purchasing Management. Investors should track economic data like the Chicago PMI to understand the economic backdrop for the various markets. The stock market likes to see healthy economic growth because that translates to higher corporate profits. The bond market prefers a moderate growth environment that won't generate inflationary pressures. The Chicago PMI gives a detailed look at the Chicago region's manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. Many market players don't realize that non-manufacturing activity is covered in this index and tend to focus on the manufacturing side only. On its own, it can be viewed as a regional indicator of general business activity. Some of the Chicago PMI's sub-indexes also provide insight on commodity prices and other clues on inflation. One should be aware that Kingsbury International, LTD releases the monthly report to those with private subscriptions three minutes prior to release to the media. This may account for occasional market activity just prior to public release.<br/><br/>This survey is somewhat local in nature - reflecting overall economic activity in the Chicago area. But many see the Chicago PMI as being representative of the overall economy.<br/><br/>Markets focus on the overall index - the Business Barometer which many refer to as the Chicago PMI.

Since the producer price index measures prices of consumer goods and capital equipment, a portion of the inflation at the producer level gets passed through to the consumer price index (CPI). By tracking price pressures in the pipeline, investors can anticipate inflationary consequences in coming months.<br/><br/>While the CPI is the price index with the most impact in setting interest rates, the PPI provides significant information earlier in the production process. As a starting point, interest rates have an \\\"inflation premium\\\" and components for risk factors. A lender will want the money paid back from a loan to at least have the same purchasing power as when loaned. The interest rate at a minimum equals the inflation rate to maintain purchasing power and this generally is based on the CPI. Changes in inflation lead to changes in interest rates and, in turn, in equity prices.<br/><br/>The PPI comes in three versions: finished goods; intermediate supplies, materials & components; and crude materials that need further processing. The finished goods PPI is most often cited in the media. This index covers final products bought from producers by businesses to sell to consumers or to use for capital equipment.<br/><br/>The PPI is considered a precursor of both consumer price inflation and profits. If the prices paid to manufacturers increase, businesses are faced with either charging higher prices or they taking a cut in profits. The ability to pass along price increases depends on the strength and competitiveness of the marketplace.<br/><br/>Producer prices are more volatile than consumer prices. The CPI includes services components - which are more stable than goods - and the PPI does not. Wages are a bigger share of the costs at the retail level than at the producer level.

Changes in the budget balance of the annual fiscal year (which begins in October) are followed as an indicator of budgetary trends and the thrust of fiscal policy.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>The budget data have several direct and indirect meanings for the financial markets. The most direct relationship lies between the size of the budget deficit and the supply of Treasury securities. The higher the deficit, the more Treasury notes and bonds the government must sell to finance its operation. From there it's simple supply and demand -- if demand is constant but the supply of bonds goes up, the price goes down. The same is true if the deficit falls or is eliminated altogether -- the government needs to sell fewer Treasury bonds, so the supply drops and the price of T-bonds rises. In the past few years, the budget deficit has increased dramatically, and this has put more Treasury securities into the market place.<br/><br/>The Federal government borrows money through the issuance of Treasury securities; so higher deficits mean a larger supply of securities and (again, assuming constant demand) lower prices. With notes and bonds, lower prices are equated with higher yields, so in this example, the government borrows money at higher interest rates. That impact ripples across all other interest rate-bearing securities and creates a higher interest-rate environment for stocks, which is bearish.<br/><br/>In addition to following the trend in the budget deficit or surplus, investors can gain valuable insight to the state of the economy by looking at the government's tax receipts.

In particular, by looking at the ratio of inventories to sales, investors can see how fast production will grow in coming months. For example, if inventory growth lags sales growth, then manufacturers will need to boost production lest product shortages occur. On the other hand, if unintended inventory accumulation occurs (i.e. sales did not meet expectations), then production will probably have to slow while those inventories are worked down.

According to State Street, \\\"the more of their portfolios that professional investors are willing to devote to riskier as opposed to safer investments, the greater their risk appetite or confidence.\\\" So when investors choose to increase their holdings of risky assets, this confirms their confidence has increased. Incidentally, State Street believes investor confidence can exist in a bear market as well as a bull market. Since market players have become so enamored with consumer attitude surveys, it probably would be useful for both professional portfolio managers and amateur investors to consider investor attitudes.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly.<br/>\",\"eclong2851389\":\" - Treasury International Capital<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>These Treasury data track the flows of financial instruments into and out of the United States.

Respondents also give their views about the likely direction of these same indicators six months ahead.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Investors track economic data like the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to understand the economic backdrop for the various markets. The stock market likes to see healthy economic growth because that translates to higher corporate profits. The bond market prefers a moderate growth environment that won't generate inflationary pressures. The Empire Manufacturing Survey gives a detailed look at New York state's manufacturing sector, how busy it is and where things are headed. Since manufacturing is a major sector of the economy, this report has a big influence on the markets. Some of the Empire State Survey sub-indexes also provide insight on commodity prices and other clues on inflation. The Federal Reserve closely watches this report because when inflation signals are flashing, policymakers can reset the direction of interest rates. As a consequence, the bond market can be highly sensitive to this report. The equity market is also sensitive to this report because it is the first clue on the nation's manufacturing sector, reported in advance of the Philadelphia Fed's business outlooks survey, the NAPM-Chicago index and the ISM manufacturing index.<br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly.<br/><br/><b>Source</b><br/>Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>The 15th of the month or next business day if the 15th is on a weekend or holiday.<br/><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/>Data are for the same month as the release month.

The data are collected for pay periods that can be interpolated to include the week of the 12th of each month, and processed with statistical methodologies similar to those used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to compute employment from its monthly survey of establishments. ADP also use ADP contracted with Macroeconomic Advisors to compute a monthly report that would ultimately help to predict monthly nonfarm payrolls from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's employment situation. The ADP report only covers private (excluding government) payrolls at this time. As a simplification of the process used by Macroeconomic Advisors, estimates are based upon statistical comparison of ADP growth rates to BLS payroll employment growth rates at the industry level. ADP also adds in the BLS initial claims data for the week just prior to the employment report as part of its estimation procedure. (Automatic Data Processing (ADP)/Macroeconomic Advisers)<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>Market players have become accustomed to the excitement on employment Friday and realize the rich detail of the monthly employment situation can help set the tone for the entire month. While economists have certainly improved their nonfarm payroll forecasts over the years, it is not unusual to see surprises on employment Friday. To that end, the new ADP national employment report can help improve the payroll forecast by providing information in advance of the employment report.<br/><br/>The employment statistics also provide insight on wage trends, and wage inflation is high on the list of enemies for the Federal Reserve. Fed officials constantly monitor this data watching for even the smallest signs of potential inflationary pressures, even when economic conditions are soggy. If inflation is under control, it is easier for the Fed to maintain a more accommodative monetary policy. If inflation is a problem, the Fed is limited in providing economic stimulus. Initially, the ADP national employment report will not have wage information, but their goal is provide wage information, along with industry and regional information as well.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, by tracking jobs, investors can sense the degree of tightness in the job market. If wage inflation threatens, it's a good bet that interest rates will rise; bond and stock prices will fall. No doubt that the only investors in a good mood will be the ones who watched the employment report and adjusted their portfolios to anticipate these events. In contrast, when job growth is slow or negative, then interest rates are likely to decline - boosting up bond and stock prices in the process. <br/><br/><b>Frequency</b><br/>Monthly<br/><br/><b>Source</b><br/>Automatic Data Processing (ADP)/Macroeconomic Advisers <br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>Two days prior to the release of the Employment Situation Report <br/><br/><b>Coverage</b><br/>Data are for the previous month.

There are two key reasons for the ISM's prominence. First, its longevity - the report was first produced in 1931, and after a break during World War II, it has produced continuously since 1948. Second , its leading quality - the ISM has been one of the better predictors of the business cycle over the years. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Who and What It Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe ISM index is the result of a monthly survey of over 400 companies in 20 industries throughout the 50 states. The survey queries respondents on a number of monthly indicators, including orders, production, employment, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, export orders, and import orders. Respondents are asked to characterize each indicator as higher, lower, or unchanged for the month (or faster/slower in the case of delivery times). They are not asked for specific numbers - only a thumbs up or down. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Presenting the Numbers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nBased on these responses, the ISM calculates diffusion indexes for each of the components. These diffusion indexes are calculated by adding half of the percentage of respondents answering \\\"unchanged\\\" to the percentage answering \\\"higher\\\" (or \\\"slower\\\" for deliveries). These diffusion indexes do not yield estimates of specific magnitudes of strength or weakness, but the more respondents who are indicating trends in the same direction - the better the chance that the magnitude of that move is larger. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nA diffusion index of 50% is the theoretical breakeven mark - with readings above indicating strength and below indicating weakness. The ISM only provides the raw data - the Department of Commerce produces the seasonal factors which are used to provide more meaningful, seasonally adjusted indexes. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe total index is not the result of a separate question regarding general business conditions (as is the case with the Philadelphia Fed index). Instead, the index is calculated using the weighted sum of five of the subindexes. Orders account for 30% of the total; production - 25%; employment - 20%; deliveries - 15%; inventories - 10%. Prices, export orders, and import orders are not part of the total index. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Breakevens in Theory and Practice</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThough 50% is the breakeven mark in theory, different readings have proved to be breakeven in practice. For new orders, 50.3% is the level consistent with breakeven readings in factory orders. For production, 49.4% has been the breakeven mark in theory and practice. For employment, 47.5% has been consistent with a steady level of manufacturing employment. For inventories, 41.3% has been consistent with steady business inventory readings. And finally, the 42.7% mark on the total index marks the point below which the overall economy is believed to be in recession. Between 42.7-50%, the manufacturing sector may be in decline, but the total economy is only seeing slower growth. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>No Services</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThis observation highlights the important element which is missing from the ISM index - the service sector. With the manufacturing sector making up an ever-shrinking percentage of the total economy - the ISM might seem to be an indicator in decline. Not so, however - the manufacturing sector, while shrinking in relative terms, still tends to lead the total economy into and out of recessions. The ISM therefore remains a closely watched indicator despite its manufacturing focus. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>A Proven Performer</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe ISM's leading quality has been proven over time. Its bottom during a recession has preceded the turning point for the business cycle by an average of four months, and its worst performance in leading the turning point was on two occasions when the ISM trough occurred in the same month as the business cycle trough.

Higher interest rates tend to slow economic activity; lower interest rates stimulate economic activity. Either way, interest rates influence the sales environment. In the consumer sector, few homes or cars will be purchased when interest rates rise. Furthermore, interest rate costs are a significant factor for many businesses, particularly for companies with high debt loads or who have to finance high inventory levels. This interest cost has a direct impact on corporate profits. The bottom line is that higher interest rates are bearish for the financial markets, while lower interest rates are bullish.\",\"eclong3581536\":\" -  Retail Sales<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>Retail sales measure the total receipts at stores that sell durable and nondurable goods.<br/><br/><b>Why Investors Care?</b><br/>With consumer spending a large part of the economy, market players continually monitor spending patterns.

This narrow piece of data has a powerful multiplier effect through the economy, and therefore across the markets and your investments. Home builders usually don't start a house unless they are fairly confident it will sell upon or before its completion. Changes in the rate of housing starts tell us a lot about demand for homes and the outlook for the construction industry. Furthermore, each time a new home is started, construction employment rises, and income will be pumped back into the economy.<br/><br/>Once the home is sold, it generates revenues for the home builder and a myriad of consumption opportunities for the buyer. Refrigerators, washers and dryers, furniture, and landscaping are just a few things new home buyers might spend money on, so the economic \\\"ripple effect\\\" can be substantial. Since the economic backdrop is the most pervasive influence on financial markets, housing starts have a direct bearing on stocks, bonds and commodities. In a more specific sense, trends in the housing starts data carry valuable clues for the stocks of home builders, mortgage lenders, and home furnishings companies.

It is a leading indicator of future spending and the business cycle. 5000 consumers in the nine census divisions across the country are surveyed each month. The level of consumer confidence is directly correlated to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy. It also correlates closely with joblessness, inflation, and real incomes. The report can occasionally be helpful in predicting sudden shifts in consumption patterns, though most small changes in the index are just noise. Only index changes of at least five points should be considered significant. The index consists of two subindexes - consumers' appraisal of current conditions and their expectations for the future. Expectations make up 60% of the total index, with current conditions accounting for the other 40%. The expectations index is typically seen as having better leading indicator qualities than the current conditions index. The more confident consumers are about the economy and their own personal finances, the more likely they are to spend. Note, changes in consumer confidence and retail sales do not move in tandem month by month. If the economy experiences a long-term expansion, buying intentions may decline even while the jobless rate declines because of the satisfaction of pent-up demand. Conversely, if inflation begins to accelerate, spending plans may increase for the short-term as consumers buy now to avoid having to pay higher prices later. Regional differences in consumer confidence are an indication of differing business cycles across the nation. This has implications for spending on durable goods and, more importantly, for residential real estate markets. Financial markets interpret rising consumer confidence as a precursor to higher consumer spending. Higher consumer spending could in turn spark inflation. Look for a change in the direction of the six month moving average of the index. Consumers do not usually have the necessary information to accurately assess income and job growth six months in the future. The report provides information on planned spending, which does not necessarily turn into actual spending, although it is unlikely that increasing consumer confidence would be followed by a decline in spending. The Consumer Confidence survey is not useful for any type of forecasting.\\r\\n\",\"eclong4001603\":\" -  Producer Price Index<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>The producer price index is a measure of the change in the general level of prices for the productive sector of New Zealand.

Prior to each meeting, market participants speculate about the possibility of an interest rate change. A post-meeting statement is issued after each meeting. Unlike the Federal Reserve, there are no post-meeting minutes. The Bank has an inflation target range of 1 percent to 3 percent with specific focus on the 2 percent midpoint. <br/><br/>Although the Bank monitors many economic indicators, as indeed all central banks do, the Bank converted its inflation barometer for operational purposes to a consumer price index measure that subtracts eight volatile components to better reflect core inflation. It also takes the foreign exchange rate for the Canadian dollar into its monetary policy decisions.<br/><br/>Monetary policy goals are to aid and abet solid economic growth along with rising living standards. To achieve these goals, inflation is kept low, stable, and predictable. The inflation control target is at the heart of Canadian monetary policy that the Bank and the Government have established. The level of interest rates and the exchange rate determine the monetary environment in which the Canadian economy operates.<br/><br/>The level of interest rates affects the economy. Higher interest rates tend to slow economic activity; lower interest rates stimulate economic activity. Either way, interest rates influence the sales environment. In the consumer sector, few homes or cars will be purchased when interest rates rise. Furthermore, interest rate costs are a significant factor for many businesses, particularly for companies with high debt loads or who have to finance high inventory levels. This interest cost has a direct impact on corporate profits.

The household survey is a survey of roughly 60,000 households. This survey produces the unemployment rate. The establishment survey is a survey of 375,000 businesses. This survey produces the nonfarm payrolls, average workweek, and average hourly earnings figures, to name a few. Both surveys cover the payroll period which includes the 12th of each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe reports both measure employment levels, just from different angles. Due to the vastly different size of the survey samples (the establishment survey not only surveys more businesses, but each business employs many individuals), the measures of employment may differ markedly from month to month. The household survey is used only for the unemployment measure - the market focusses primarily on the more comprehensive establishment survey. Together, these two surveys make up the employment report, the most timely and broad indicator of economic activity released each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nTotal payrolls are broken down into sectors such as manufacturing, mining, construction, services, and government. The markets follows these components closely as indicators of the trends in sectors of the economy; the manufacturing sector is watched the most closely as it often leads the business cycle. The data also include breakdowns of hours worked, overtime, and average hourly earnings. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe average workweek (also known as hours worked) is important for two reasons. First, it is a critical determinant of such monthly indicators as industrial production and personal income. Second, it is considered a useful indicator of labor market conditions: a rising workweek early in the business cycle may be the first indication that employers are preparing to boost their payrolls, while late in the cycle a rising workweek may indicate that employers are having difficulty finding qualified applicants for open positions. Average earnings are closely followed as an indicator of potential inflation. Like the price of any good or service, the price of labor reacts to an overly accommodative monetary policy. If the price of labor is rising sharply, it may be an indication that too much money is chasing too few goods, or in this case employees. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Depth</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is really two reports - the household survey and the establishment survey. These two surveys contain a wealth of timely information which justify this report's status as the most important economic release of the month. This same wealth of information can nevertheless turn into a dearth of knowledge if it is not placed in the proper context. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Household and Establishment Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe household and establishment surveys differ due to the source of the data, as the names suggest. The household survey is a survey of households and the establishment survey is a surveys of businesses. The establishment survey, which is sometimes referred to as the payrolls survey, is favored by the market for a simple reason - it is far more comprehensive. Both surveys attempt to measure employment conditions at the roughly the same point in time - the household survey covers the calendar week which includes the 12th of the month while the establishment survey covers the pay period (be it a week, two weeks, or longer) which includes the 12th. But the establishment survey covers 390,000 businesses which employ 47 million people, while the household survey covers just 50,000 individuals. With a sample size which is 940 times larger than the household survey, it is hardly surprising that the market is more interested in the establishment survey. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAside from the sample size, the surveys differ in other significant ways. The household survey counts farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers as employed; the establishment survey does not. The household survey can only count one individual as employed once, even if that person holds two jobs. The establishment survey will double count an individual who appears on the payrolls of two companies. There are other, less significant differences, but let's turn now to the statistics produced by the two surveys. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Establishment Survey</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Nonfarm Payrolls</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nWithout question, the single most important piece of data contained in the employment report generally and the establishment survey specifically is nonfarm payrolls. As the name implies, nonfarm payrolls measure the number of people on the payrolls of all non-agricultural businesses. The monthly changes in payrolls can be quite volatile, occasionally varying by better than 200K from one month to the next. Even with this volatility and the possibility of large revisions to past data, the payrolls figures offer the most timely and comprehensive snapshot of the economy. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Average Workweek</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe workweek, also referred to as hours worked, is an often underrated indicator in the establishment survey. The average number of hours worked by employees on nonfarm payrolls is an important determinant of both industrial production and personal income in any given month. The workweek typically sees changes of a tenth or two each month, but can see much larger swings, such as the four tenth decline reported for October. To understand the importance of these changes in the workweek, note that a one tenth decline in the average workweek of 120 mln workers (roughly the current level of employment) results in 12 mln fewer hours worked. To create a similar decline in manhours through a change in employment, payrolls would have to fall 340K. For the purposes of production and income calculations, a one tenth of an hour change in the workweek is equivalent to a 340K change in employment. Needless to say, the workweek data are therefore critical in judging the overall strength or weakness of the employment report. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Aggregate Hours Worked</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe aggregate hours worked index simply brings together the two series we just noted. By calculating an index which looks at both employment and the workweek, we get a complete picture of the total hours worked each month. This indicator is seen as a monthly proxy for GDP. By definition, the quarterly change in the amount of goods produced is equal to the change in manhours plus the change in productivity. As productivity is somewhat predictable from quarter to quarter, the aggregate hours worked index provides a helpful monthly read on the overall economy. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Average Hourly Earnings</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe last indicator from the establishment survey which is worthy of close inspection is average hourly earnings, which is important for two reasons. Alongside total manhours, the average earnings figure gives us a good indication of personal income growth during the month. Second, the earnings figures are closely watched during periods of strong economic growth for evidence of increasing wage pressures. Such has certainly been the case over the past year, as the market's reaction to the employment data has often turned on the change in hourly earnings and its implications for the inflation outlook.\\r\\n\",\"eclong4321685\":\" -  Melbourne Institute Inflation Expectations<br/><br/><b>Definition</b><br/>The Melbourne Institute Survey of Consumer Inflationary Expectations produces a direct measure of inflationary expectations.

Figures for several series are available from 1957 onward, but the coverage of firms varied over time. For example, while in the early 1990s more than 8,000 enterprises were included, nowadays the survey covers about 9,000. Those are divided into four major groups: Large, small and medium-sized as well as principal enterprises. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe survey contains questions about quantitative data as well as qualitative judgements concerning the following developments: \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n1. Business conditions\\r\\n<br>2. Supply and demand conditions for products and inventories as well as prices\\r\\n<br>3. Sales\\r\\n<br>4. Corporate profits\\r\\n<br>5. Fixed investments and production capacity\\r\\n<br>6. Employment conditions \\r\\n<br>7. Corporate finance as well as the lending attitude of financial institutions and changes in interest rates on loans. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe qualitative judgements are the basis on which the Bank of Japan calculates so-called diffusion indexes. Firms choose between several alternatives, for example \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n1. favourable/non-favourable for business conditions\\r\\n<br>2. excessive/insufficient for demand conditions, inventory levels, production capacity and employment\\r\\n<br>3. easy/tight for corporate finance\\r\\n<br>4. accommodative/severe for the lending attitude of financial institutions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe diffusion indexes are constructed by subtracting the portion of responses with a negative tone from those with a positive one. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tankan may give an overall impression of the business climate in Japan, but its reliance is weakened by at least two aspects: \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the construction of data from qualitative judgements somewhat disguises the fact that these only describe a rough tendency of momentary views of parts of the business community - soft information which can be no substitute for strong numbers. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, as far as the firms are aware of the role of the Tankan as an indicator not only for the general public but also for policy decisions they may be tempted to influence it in one direction or the other by choosing their responses respectively.\\r\\n\",\"eclong54\":\"<br><br>Housing Starts are a measure of the number of residential units on which construction is begun each month. A start in construction is defined as the beginning of excavation of the foundation for the building and is comprised primarily of residential housing. Building permits are permits taken out in order to allow excavation. An increase in building permits and starts usually occurs a few months after a reduction in mortgage rates. Permits lead starts, but permits are not required in all regions of the country, and the level of permits therefore tends to be less than the level of starts over time. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe monthly national report is broken down by region: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Briefing recommends analyzing the regional data because they are subject to a high degree of volatility. The high volatility can be attributed to weather changes and/or natural disasters. For example, an unexpectedly high level of rain in South could delay housing starts for the region.\\r\\n\",\"eclong55\":\"<br><br><span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Brief</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is actually two separate reports which are the results of two separate surveys. The household survey is a survey of roughly 60,000 households. This survey produces the unemployment rate. The establishment survey is a survey of 375,000 businesses. This survey produces the nonfarm payrolls, average workweek, and average hourly earnings figures, to name a few. Both surveys cover the payroll period which includes the 12th of each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe reports both measure employment levels, just from different angles. Due to the vastly different size of the survey samples (the establishment survey not only surveys more businesses, but each business employs many individuals), the measures of employment may differ markedly from month to month. The household survey is used only for the unemployment measure - the market focusses primarily on the more comprehensive establishment survey. Together, these two surveys make up the employment report, the most timely and broad indicator of economic activity released each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nTotal payrolls are broken down into sectors such as manufacturing, mining, construction, services, and government. The markets follows these components closely as indicators of the trends in sectors of the economy; the manufacturing sector is watched the most closely as it often leads the business cycle. The data also include breakdowns of hours worked, overtime, and average hourly earnings. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe average workweek (also known as hours worked) is important for two reasons. First, it is a critical determinant of such monthly indicators as industrial production and personal income. Second, it is considered a useful indicator of labor market conditions: a rising workweek early in the business cycle may be the first indication that employers are preparing to boost their payrolls, while late in the cycle a rising workweek may indicate that employers are having difficulty finding qualified applicants for open positions. Average earnings are closely followed as an indicator of potential inflation. Like the price of any good or service, the price of labor reacts to an overly accommodative monetary policy. If the price of labor is rising sharply, it may be an indication that too much money is chasing too few goods, or in this case employees. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\"><b>In Depth</b></span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is really two reports - the household survey and the establishment survey. These two surveys contain a wealth of timely information which justify this report's status as the most important economic release of the month. This same wealth of information can nevertheless turn into a dearth of knowledge if it is not placed in the proper context. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Household and Establishment Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe household and establishment surveys differ due to the source of the data, as the names suggest. The household survey is a survey of households and the establishment survey is a surveys of businesses. The establishment survey, which is sometimes referred to as the payrolls survey, is favored by the market for a simple reason - it is far more comprehensive. Both surveys attempt to measure employment conditions at the roughly the same point in time - the household survey covers the calendar week which includes the 12th of the month while the establishment survey covers the pay period (be it a week, two weeks, or longer) which includes the 12th. But the establishment survey covers 390,000 businesses which employ 47 million people, while the household survey covers just 50,000 individuals. With a sample size which is 940 times larger than the household survey, it is hardly surprising that the market is more interested in the establishment survey. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAside from the sample size, the surveys differ in other significant ways. The household survey counts farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers as employed; the establishment survey does not. The household survey can only count one individual as employed once, even if that person holds two jobs. The establishment survey will double count an individual who appears on the payrolls of two companies. There are other, less significant differences, but let's turn now to the statistics produced by the two surveys. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Household Survey</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Unemployment Rate</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAs we noted earlier, the household survey is not nearly as reliable as the establishment survey due to the small size of the survey sample. This survey nevertheless receives attention, primarily because it is responsible for the one figure which is guaranteed to lead the nightly news - the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate demands little explanation, though it is worth noting that the rate can occasionally sees significant monthly changes which are due to flukes in the data. The rate is simply the result of dividing the number of people unemployed (labor force less employed) by the number of people in the labor force. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe problem is that the employment and labor force measures in the household survey are far more volatile than even nonfarm payrolls. The reason, of course, is the small survey sample size. It is therefore useful to look at the labor force and employment figures themselves to determine if changes in the unemployment rate are due to aberrant swings in one or both of these series. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nBeyond the basics of tallying up the labor force and employment, the household survey breaks down these totals in every way imaginable - by gender, race, age, type of job, duration of unemployment, and on and on. These breakdowns seldom are of interest to the financial markets. Perhaps the only two exceptions are the discouraged worker and part-time worker measures. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Discouraged Workers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nDiscouraged workers are people who have dropped out of the labor force because they have become discouraged about their job prospects. During hard times, this statistic is often watched alongside the unemployment rate. If the job situation gets exceptionally bleak, it is possible to see the unemployment rate remaining stable not because people are finding jobs, but because they have given up looking and dropped out of the labor force. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Part-Time Workers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe issue of part time employment has arisen in recent years as many analysts have argued that strong payroll growth reflected the increase in the number of workers holding multiple part-time jobs. Since the payroll data do not differentiate between full and part-time workers, it is possible that a sudden surge in part-time employment which reflected poor full-time job prospects would actually boost payroll growth. In reality, it does not appear that this has happened, as part-time employment has been relatively steady in recent years. This figure nevertheless receives attention from time to time. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Big Picture</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nGiven the wealth of data contained in the employment report, it is important to take all of these indicators into account when passing judgment on the report. Looking at payrolls along is often misleading, as the workweek, earnings, and household employment measures may be telling a different story. Taken together, however, and taken with the caveats concerning monthly volatility and revisions, the employment report offers the best monthly glimpse of the economy.\\r\\n\",\"eclong56\":\"<br><br>The index of Industrial Production is a fixed-weight measure of the physical output of the nation's factories, mines, and utilities. Manufacturing production, the largest component of the total, can be accurately predicted using total manufacturing hours worked from the employment report. One of the bigger wildcards in this report is utility production, which can be quite volatile due to swings in the weather. Severe hot or cold spells can boost production as increased heating/cooling needs drive utility production up. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nIn addition to production, this monthly report also provides a measure of capacity utilization. Though the rate of capacity utilization is seen as a critical gauge of the slack available in the economy, the market does not completely trust this measure. Capacity is very difficult to measure, and the Fed essentially assumes that growth in capacity in any given year follows a straight line. One can therefore predict the capacity utilization rate quite accurately based on the assumption for production growth. The 85% mark is seen as a key barrier over which inflationary pressures are generated, but given revisions to these data and the difficulties with capacity measurement, the 85% mark should be viewed cautiously. It would be appropriate to look for corroborating inflation indications from commodity prices and vendor deliveries.\\r\\n\",\"eclong59\":\"<br><br>Nonfarm productivity and costs provide measures of the productivity of workers and the costs associated with producing a unit of output. During times of inflationary concern, the unit labor cost index in this report can move the market. If productivity is falling, unit labor costs may be rising faster than hourly earnings and other labor cost measures. Because productivity can be quite volatile from one quarter to the next and because the previously released GDP report will give a good indication of productivity growth, this report seldom has a significant impact on the market. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nIn addition to the preliminary report, a revision to the productivity data is released in the third month of each quarter. As with the preliminary report, the GDP data released prior to the productivity data provide a clear indication of the direction of the productivity revision. \\r\\n\",\"eclong6\":\"<br><br>The construction spending report is broken down between residential, non-residential, and public expenditures on new construction. The monthly changes are both volatile and subject to huge revisions, so this report rarely has any market impact. Only trends extending over three months or more can be viewed as significant.<br><br>The spending figures are in both nominal and real (inflation adjusted) dollars. The real figures for residential and nonresidential spending are used by economists to forecast the investment component of quarterly GDP. The annualized percent changes between the quarterly averages of these two components match up well with residential investment and commercial structure changes in the GDP accounts.\",\"eclong60\":\"<br><br><span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Brief</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe monthly Treasury budget data follow strong seasonal patterns which produce huge month-to-month fluctuations in the deficit. These fluctuations tell us little about long term budget trends. To the extent that the market analyses the monthly Treasury data, the focus is on year/year changes in receipts and outlays, since the data are not seasonally adjusted. Only in April, the most important month for tax inflows to the Treasury, does the market pay any attention to this report. The data can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by using daily data in the Daily Treasury Statement.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\">In Depth</span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The President's Budget</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe annual budget process begins in late January or early February with the presentation of the President's budget for the coming fiscal year. The President's proposals serve as an outline for Congress, particularly when the White House and Congress are controlled by the same party. In the 1980s, the conflicting agendas of the President and Congress often resulted in a final budget which bore little resemblance to the President's budget. After a quiet budget year in 1994 when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, the Republican takeover of the House and Senate has produced more contentious budget battles in 1995 and 1996.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nOne of the most common misperceptions about the budget process is that the annual budgeting actually covers all federal spending. Though the President's proposed budget will include projections for all federal government outlays, less than half of all spending is actually controlled by the annual budget legislation. Roughly 67% of federal outlays are mandated by \\\"permanent\\\" law. Unless these laws are changed, no legislative review of spending programs funded by permanent law is required in the appropriations process. The same is true of federal receipts, where permanent law does not require annual review of taxation.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nPermanent law should not by any means be construed as suggesting true permanence. Permanent laws are changed frequently, with the 1990 and 1993 budget deals being the most recent examples. These recent efforts to reduce the deficit have incorporated both changes in discretionary spending and changes in permanent laws affecting taxes and spending. Such deficit reduction efforts are usually packaged into a so-called Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). In the absence of these comprehensive deficit reduction efforts, the annual budget review will only deal with discretionary spending which makes up roughly 33% of the budget. It is perhaps one of the better kept secrets in Washington that the annual budget review which seems at the core of the democratic process does not in fact review even half of all federal spending.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Budget Resolution</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nOnce the President has submitted his budget to Congress, the legislative process begins. Within six weeks of the date that the President presents his budget, each Congressional committee must report to the House and Senate Budget Committees regarding budget estimates for programs overseen by their committee. The Budget Committees then approve a budget resolution based on these estimates. After full House and Senate approval of these resolutions, any differences between the House and Senate versions are worked out in conference committee and then a final resolution is approved by each house. This process is scheduled to be completed by April 15, but is often delayed, as was the case this year. As the budget resolution is only a blueprint for the budget and not actual legislation, it does not require presidential approval.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Appropriations Bills</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe real job of budgeting begins after the budget resolution is adopted. The appropriations process is when actual budget authority for discretionary programs is legislated. We have already noted that annual budgeting only covers discretionary programs, which are responsible for just 33% of total spending. Even these discretionary programs are not bundled into one budget package. The annual budget for discretionary spending is actually comprised of 13 separate appropriations bills. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees each include 13 subcommittees which are responsible for the 13 bills. The 13 subcommittees are listed below.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Subcommittees of the House and Senate Committees</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n Agriculture\\r\\n<br>Commerce\\r\\n<br>Justice\\r\\n<br>Defense\\r\\n<br>Dis. of Columbia\\r\\n<br>Energy\\r\\n<br>Water Foreign Ops.\\r\\n<br>Interior\\r\\n<br>Labor\\r\\n<br>Health\\r\\n<br>Legislative Military Const.\\r\\n<br>Transportation\\r\\n<br>Treasury\\r\\n<br>Postal Service\\r\\n<br>Veterans\\r\\n<br>HUD\\r\\n<br>Agencies  \\r\\n \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAs all tax and spending bills must originate in the House, the House Appropriations subcommittees will see the first action in the appropriations process. The 13 bills are crafted individually and do not work their way through the House and Senate on the same timetable. The goal is of course to complete legislation on all 13 bills by the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1. Yet these bills proceed and are approved of on their own, and are not packaged into one comprehensive bill known simply as the budget.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nOnce a House Appropriations subcommittee approves its bill, the legislation proceeds to the full Committee and then to the House floor. Approval by the House sets in motion the same process in the Senate. Upon approval by the full Senate, differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill are reconciled in conference committee and then a final version of the bill is sent back to the House and Senate floors. Presidential approval of each of the 13 appropriations bills completes the process. When work on the 13 bills is delayed past the start of the fiscal year, Congress and the President must approve of continuing resolutions which fund government programs at the prior year's level until the relevant appropriations bill is signed into law.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nOne final note about the appropriations process is that the appropriations bills do not set actual outlays for the coming fiscal year, but instead legislate \\\"budget authority.\\\" The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines budget authority as \\\"the authority to incur legally binding obligations of the Government that will result in immediate or future outlays.\\\" Actual outlays may exceed or fall short of budget authority in any given year depending on past budget authority and the duration of a program.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nIn years such as 1985, 1987, 1990, and 1993, Congress has enacted legislation aimed at long term deficit reduction. These legislative efforts occur separately from the annual appropriations process. They may change permanent laws and set caps which affect discretionary spending, but the regular budget process will nevertheless be unchanged. OBRA legislation affects permanent law and is not a substitute for annual budgets. OBRA legislation packages changes in permanent laws which will typically affect both taxation and mandatory spending. The legislative process for OBRA is completely different than the appropriations process. Legislation is still initiated in the House, but is not limited to work by the Appropriations Committee. The House Ways and Means Committee oversees tax law, and thus plays a critical role in OBRA legislation, as does its Senate counterpart, the Finance Committee. Legislation affecting entitlement programs also falls under the jurisdiction of committees other than Appropriations, i.e. proposed Medicare changes would be considered by a House Ways and Means subcommittee on health care.\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Supplemental Appropriations</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe 13 appropriations bills are not necessarily the last word for the year on federal spending. Supplemental appropriations bills may be approved at any time to provide additional funding for government programs. Tight caps on discretionary spending set by the 1990 and 1993 budget acts require a pay-as-you-go approach to such funding, thus limiting the number of supplemental appropriations. \\\"Emergency\\\" spending circumvents the pay-as-you-go mandate, however, allowing for a variety of supplemental appropriations. Past \\\"emergencies\\\" have covered everything from the Gulf War to extended unemployment insurance to natural disaster relief.\\r\\n\",\"eclong61\":\"Business Confidence\",\"eclong63\":\"Personal Consumption\",\"eclong68\":\"Consumer Spending\",\"eclong69\":\"GFK Consumer Sentiment\",\"eclong7\":\"<br><br>The durable orders release measures the dollar volume of orders, shipments, and unfilled orders of durable goods (defined as goods whose intended lifespan is three years or more).

The household survey is a survey of roughly 60,000 households. This survey produces the unemployment rate. The establishment survey is a survey of 375,000 businesses. This survey produces the nonfarm payrolls, average workweek, and average hourly earnings figures, to name a few. Both surveys cover the payroll period which includes the 12th of each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe reports both measure employment levels, just from different angles. Due to the vastly different size of the survey samples (the establishment survey not only surveys more businesses, but each business employs many individuals), the measures of employment may differ markedly from month to month. The household survey is used only for the unemployment measure - the market focusses primarily on the more comprehensive establishment survey. Together, these two surveys make up the employment report, the most timely and broad indicator of economic activity released each month. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nTotal payrolls are broken down into sectors such as manufacturing, mining, construction, services, and government. The markets follows these components closely as indicators of the trends in sectors of the economy; the manufacturing sector is watched the most closely as it often leads the business cycle. The data also include breakdowns of hours worked, overtime, and average hourly earnings. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe average workweek (also known as hours worked) is important for two reasons. First, it is a critical determinant of such monthly indicators as industrial production and personal income. Second, it is considered a useful indicator of labor market conditions: a rising workweek early in the business cycle may be the first indication that employers are preparing to boost their payrolls, while late in the cycle a rising workweek may indicate that employers are having difficulty finding qualified applicants for open positions. Average earnings are closely followed as an indicator of potential inflation. Like the price of any good or service, the price of labor reacts to an overly accommodative monetary policy. If the price of labor is rising sharply, it may be an indication that too much money is chasing too few goods, or in this case employees. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<span style=\\\"color:#0092dd;\\\"><b>In Depth</b></span>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe employment report is really two reports - the household survey and the establishment survey. These two surveys contain a wealth of timely information which justify this report's status as the most important economic release of the month. This same wealth of information can nevertheless turn into a dearth of knowledge if it is not placed in the proper context. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Household and Establishment Surveys</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe household and establishment surveys differ due to the source of the data, as the names suggest. The household survey is a survey of households and the establishment survey is a surveys of businesses. The establishment survey, which is sometimes referred to as the payrolls survey, is favored by the market for a simple reason - it is far more comprehensive. Both surveys attempt to measure employment conditions at the roughly the same point in time - the household survey covers the calendar week which includes the 12th of the month while the establishment survey covers the pay period (be it a week, two weeks, or longer) which includes the 12th. But the establishment survey covers 390,000 businesses which employ 47 million people, while the household survey covers just 50,000 individuals. With a sample size which is 940 times larger than the household survey, it is hardly surprising that the market is more interested in the establishment survey. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAside from the sample size, the surveys differ in other significant ways. The household survey counts farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers as employed; the establishment survey does not. The household survey can only count one individual as employed once, even if that person holds two jobs. The establishment survey will double count an individual who appears on the payrolls of two companies. There are other, less significant differences, but let's turn now to the statistics produced by the two surveys. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Household Survey</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Unemployment Rate</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nAs we noted earlier, the household survey is not nearly as reliable as the establishment survey due to the small size of the survey sample. This survey nevertheless receives attention, primarily because it is responsible for the one figure which is guaranteed to lead the nightly news - the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate demands little explanation, though it is worth noting that the rate can occasionally sees significant monthly changes which are due to flukes in the data. The rate is simply the result of dividing the number of people unemployed (labor force less employed) by the number of people in the labor force. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe problem is that the employment and labor force measures in the household survey are far more volatile than even nonfarm payrolls. The reason, of course, is the small survey sample size. It is therefore useful to look at the labor force and employment figures themselves to determine if changes in the unemployment rate are due to aberrant swings in one or both of these series. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nBeyond the basics of tallying up the labor force and employment, the household survey breaks down these totals in every way imaginable - by gender, race, age, type of job, duration of unemployment, and on and on. These breakdowns seldom are of interest to the financial markets. Perhaps the only two exceptions are the discouraged worker and part-time worker measures. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Discouraged Workers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nDiscouraged workers are people who have dropped out of the labor force because they have become discouraged about their job prospects. During hard times, this statistic is often watched alongside the unemployment rate. If the job situation gets exceptionally bleak, it is possible to see the unemployment rate remaining stable not because people are finding jobs, but because they have given up looking and dropped out of the labor force. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>Part-Time Workers</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe issue of part time employment has arisen in recent years as many analysts have argued that strong payroll growth reflected the increase in the number of workers holding multiple part-time jobs. Since the payroll data do not differentiate between full and part-time workers, it is possible that a sudden surge in part-time employment which reflected poor full-time job prospects would actually boost payroll growth. In reality, it does not appear that this has happened, as part-time employment has been relatively steady in recent years. This figure nevertheless receives attention from time to time. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n<b>The Big Picture</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nGiven the wealth of data contained in the employment report, it is important to take all of these indicators into account when passing judgment on the report. Looking at payrolls along is often misleading, as the workweek, earnings, and household employment measures may be telling a different story. Taken together, however, and taken with the caveats concerning monthly volatility and revisions, the employment report offers the best monthly glimpse of the economy.\\r\\n\",\"eclong74\":\"Economic Sentiment\",\"eclong75\":\"Industrial Sentiment\",\"eclong76\":\"Service Sentiment\",\"eclong78\":\"<br><br><b>In Brief</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThere are many regional manufacturing surveys, and they tend to be ranked in order of timeliness and the importance of the region. The Philadelphia Fed's survey is first each month, actually coming out during the third week of the month for which it is reporting. Several smaller surveys are then released before the Chicago purchasing managers' report on the last day of each month. A few, such as the Atlanta and Richmond Fed surveys, are released after the NAPM and are of little value. The purchasing managers' reports are measured like the national NAPM - 50% marks the breakeven line between an expanding and contracting manufacturing sector. For the Philadelphia and Atlanta Fed indexes, 0 is the breakeven mark. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese surveys can be of some help in forecasting the national NAPM - particularly the Philadelphia and Chicago surveys which are more closely watched due to their timeliness and the fact that these regions represent a reasonable cross section of national manufacturing activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>In Depth</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe market has been bombarded with a bevy of surveys purporting to measure manufacturing activity in every nook and cranny of the country. First it was Philadelphia, then Chicago, and Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Cincinnati, Richmond, Atlanta, Boston, and there might as well have been a Nome survey. This hodge-podge of releases is begging for someone - namely us - to come along and cut this group down to a more manageable size. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Nuts and Bolts</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nLet's start with the issue of what these manufacturing surveys are trying to measure and how they go about doing it. The leader of this pack of regional surveys is the ISM index which comes from the Institute for Supply Management (formerly the National Association of Purchasing Managers). It has been around since 1931 (1948 on an uninterrupted basis), it is national, and it is one of the most timely measures of manufacturing activity available. In other words, it sets the standards by which its progeny are measured. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ISM index is actually a composite of five sub-indexes - new orders, production, supplier deliveries, inventories, and employment. In surveying over 300 companies each month, the ISM asks for positive, negative, or unchanged readings on each of these indicators. The positive responses are added to one half of the unchanged responses to produce the diffusion index. For example, if 50% of respondents reported stronger orders, 40% reported weaker, and 10% unchanged, the diffusion index for orders would be 55%, the 50% positive plus half of the 10% unchanged. To calculate the total index, the ISM uses weights for the five indicators, which are as follows: 30% new orders, 25% production, 20% employment, 15% supplier deliveries, and 10% inventories. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>The Selection Criteria</b>\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nSince this methodology has made the ISM index one of the better leading indicators of economic activity over the years, we will measure the usefulness of the regional indexes based on their ability to help in forecasting the national index. In our effort to arrive at the most important regional indices, these criteria make eliminating most of the candidates easy for one simple reason - they are released after the national index. While regional economic developments are of interest to those who live in the region, they are not particularly important to the markets. If a region cannot help in forecasting national trends, then its data are not particularly useful.

We looked at the correlation of all of these indexes to the national NAPM and found substantial differences in their forecasting ability. The winners are...drum roll please...Chicago and Philadelphia, in that order. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chicago PMI (officially known as the Business Barometer) is a monthly composite index based on opinion surveys of more than 200 Chicago purchasing managers regarding the manufacturing industry. The survey responses are limited to three options: slower, faster and same. As such, the index will not capture if a component is growing but at a much slower rate or vice versa. The index is a composite of seven similarly constructed indexes including: new orders, production, supplier delivery times, backlogs, inventories, prices paid, and employment. New orders and orders backlog indices indicate future production activity. It signals factory-sector expansion when it is above 50 and contraction when below it. The index is seasonally adjusted for the effects of variations within the year, differences due to holidays and institutional changes. Because it is an opinion survey, it is often influenced by respondents’ perception of current events, as opposed to actual hard data. Also, it does not capture technological <br><br>and production changes, which make it possible for production to expand, while employment contracts. Because the Chicago PMI is released the day before the ISM, it is watched in order to predict the more important ISM report (the Chicago PMI has an impressive 91% correlation with the ISM national NAPM), which is in itself a good leading indicator of overall economic activity. It frequently moves markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>The Philadelphia Fed index, which is released on the third Thursday of the month (with data for the same month), was a distant second at 76%. Philly Fed's performance improved slightly to 78% when Briefing measured its results using the NAPM methodology. The Philly index as released is not a composite of its subindexes, as the NAPM is. Instead, the Philly Fed survey asks many questions, but the total index is based on the general question \\\"are business conditions better or worse than last month.\\\" It is often the case that a weighted measure of the individual questions on specifics such as new orders and production moves in a different direction than the index based on the general question. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe rest of the regional indexes fared poorly, ranging from correlations as poor as 55% (APICS) to 73% (Milwaukee).

In the future, then, we would recommend setting aside most of the regional manufacturing surveys and focussing on just Philly and Chicago, which offer the best hope of predicting the national index.

The winners are...drum roll please...Chicago and Philadelphia, in that order. \\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chicago PMI (officially known as the Business Barometer) is a monthly composite index based on opinion surveys of more than 200 Chicago purchasing managers regarding the manufacturing industry. The survey responses are limited to three options: slower, faster and same. As such, the index will not capture if a component is growing but at a much slower rate or vice versa. The index is a composite of seven similarly constructed indexes including: new orders, production, supplier delivery times, backlogs, inventories, prices paid, and employment. New orders and orders backlog indices indicate future production activity. It signals factory-sector expansion when it is above 50 and contraction when below it. The index is seasonally adjusted for the effects of variations within the year, differences due to holidays and institutional changes. Because it is an opinion survey, it is often influenced by respondents’ perception of current events, as opposed to actual hard data. Also, it does not capture technological <br><br>and production changes, which make it possible for production to expand, while employment contracts. Because the Chicago PMI is released the day before the ISM, it is watched in order to predict the more important ISM report (the Chicago PMI has an impressive 91% correlation with the ISM national NAPM), which is in itself a good leading indicator of overall economic activity. It frequently moves markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>The Philadelphia Fed index, which is released on the third Thursday of the month (with data for the same month), was a distant second at 76%. Philly Fed's performance improved slightly to 78% when Briefing measured its results using the NAPM methodology. The Philly index as released is not a composite of its subindexes, as the NAPM is. Instead, the Philly Fed survey asks many questions, but the total index is based on the general question \\\"are business conditions better or worse than last month.\\\" It is often the case that a weighted measure of the individual questions on specifics such as new orders and production moves in a different direction than the index based on the general question. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<br><br>\\r\\nThe rest of the regional indexes fared poorly, ranging from correlations as poor as 55% (APICS) to 73% (Milwaukee). Chicago was the clear winner, but the Philly Fed index definitely deserves recognition, particularly since it is released so much earlier than the rest. In the future, then, we would recommend setting aside most of the regional manufacturing surveys and focussing on just Philly and Chicago, which offer the best hope of predicting the national index. And when you look at the Philly index, improve your chances by looking at the Philly numbers calculated on an NAPM basis, which Briefing will be happy to provide. \\r\\n\",\"eclong96\":\"<br><br>This survey measures the level of confidence individual households have in the performance of the economy now and in the future. It is a leading indicator of future spending and the business cycle. 5000 consumers in the nine census divisions across the country are surveyed each month. The level of consumer confidence is directly correlated to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy. It also correlates closely with joblessness, inflation, and real incomes. The report can occasionally be helpful in predicting sudden shifts in consumption patterns, though most small changes in the index are just noise. Only index changes of at least five points should be considered significant. The index consists of two subindexes - consumers' appraisal of current conditions and their expectations for the future. Expectations make up 60% of the total index, with current conditions accounting for the other 40%. The expectations index is typically seen as having better leading indicator qualities than the current conditions index. The more confident consumers are about the economy and their own personal finances, the more likely they are to spend. Note, changes in consumer confidence and retail sales do not move in tandem month by month. If the economy experiences a long-term expansion, buying intentions may decline even while the jobless rate declines because of the satisfaction of pent-up demand. Conversely, if inflation begins to accelerate, spending plans may increase for the short-term as consumers buy now to avoid having to pay higher prices later. Regional differences in consumer confidence are an indication of differing business cycles across the nation. This has implications for spending on durable goods and, more importantly, for residential real estate markets. Financial markets interpret rising consumer confidence as a precursor to higher consumer spending. Higher consumer spending could in turn spark inflation. Look for a change in the direction of the six month moving average of the index. Consumers do not usually have the necessary information to accurately assess income and job growth six months in the future. The report provides information on planned spending, which does not necessarily turn into actual spending, although it is unlikely that increasing consumer confidence would be followed by a decline in spending. The Consumer Confidence survey is not useful for any type of forecasting.\\r\\n\",\"eclong99\":\"EIA Crude Oil Inventories\"}",
