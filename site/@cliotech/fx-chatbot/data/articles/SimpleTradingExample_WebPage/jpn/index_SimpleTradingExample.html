                  When you trade CFDs with iFOREX, you can take advantage of any change in any price change of a specific instrument, regardless if you think it'll rise or fall. Think the price of an instrument will fall? Open a ‘Sell’ deal. Think it will rise? Open a 'Buy' deal.

               <p id="text2">
                  This is how to open a deal with iFOREX in four quick steps:
               </p>
               <ol class="NumList">
                  <li>
                     Choose a CFD instrument <span class="ListText" >(a currency pair, commodity, share, crypto, etc.)
                     In this example, let's go with WTI Crude Oil, and assume a single CFD costs $60.</span>
                     </span>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Choose your deal size<br>
                     <span class="ListText" >
                     The maximum leverage on oil is 200:1. So, with a $200 investment, you can open a deal of up to $40,000.
                     How come? Well:
                     <br>
                     <span class="ListTextOrenge">$200 X 200 = $40,000</span>
                     <br>
                     How many $60 contracts can we buy with $40,000? 
                     <br>
                     Let's round it down to <span class="ListTextOrenge">650</span>.
                     </span>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Choose a direction
                     <br>
                     <span class="ListText" >Remember the ‘Buy’ and ‘Sell’ deals? In this case, we’ll choose a ‘Buy’ position, meaning we think the price of oil is going to rise.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Close your deal
                     <br>
                     <span class="ListText" >Let’s say the price of oil rose by $2. You decide to close the deal. What’s your profit?</span>
                  </li>
               </ol>

					 <span class="ListText" >
                        If you’re answer is $2, that’s not quite right, because, as you recall, we bought 650 contracts. So, your real profit is actually:
                       </span> 
						<br>
                        $2 (profit) x 650 (contracts) = $1,300.
                     </p>

                  <li>
                     <p class="ListTextSection" >
                        As you see, opening a deal on the iFOREX trading platform is pretty easy. Ready to continue? Let’s go.
